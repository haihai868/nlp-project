Most adults in the community have been infected with Cytomegalovirus (CMV), most are asymptomatic and the virus will remain latent for life.
There have been convincing medical evidence that CMV is an important pathogen in immunocompromised subjects.
However, recent studies have shown that re-infection or reactivation of CMV in critical illness patients without immunosuppression is common and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity.
The most common lesions are interstitial pneumonia and hepatitis.
The diagnosis should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's disease history such as identifying risk factors (severe sepsis, prolonged hospital stay, repeated blood transfusion), liver damage, lung (interstitial lung diseases), reducing blood counts that cannot be explained by other causes.
The CMV PCR test in the blood as well as in the tracheal lavage fluid helps to confirm the diagnosis, but there is no clear threshold to make treatment decisions.
Gancilovir is the main and effective treatment for this group of patients.
Comments on impaired glucose tolerance test results in patients at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus at Thai Binh Medical University Hospital
Lactic acidosis is an accumulation of too much lactic acid in the blood, a common metabolic acidosis, especially in severe cases, when lactic acidosis is a complication of main disease.
In clinical practice, people are divided into 2 types: Lactic acidosis type A is often caused by lack of oxygen in the tissue, type B is caused by the combination with other diseases.
Lactic acidosis typically occurs due to glucose metabolism in the absence of tissue oxygenation or by the liver's inability to remove lactic acid.
Severe acidosis can reduce the contractile force of the heart, increase pulmonary vascular resistance, increase myocardial sensitivity to arrhythmia, increase blood potassium, inhibit metabolism in cells or at molecular level.
Mortality is high, from 40 - 60% of cases.

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia among breast cancer patients treated with 4AC - 4T regimen at Thai Nguyen oncology center
α-thalassemia disease is mostly caused by mutations in the HBA1 and HBA2 genes that lead to the deficiency in the α-globin chain, which builds up the haemoglobin molecule.
Depending on the number of missing α chains, the clinical manifestations of the disease are at different levels.
This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, hence identifying healthy individuals carrying mutations in the α-thalassemia gene is essential for prenatal and premarital genetic counselling to reduce the incidence in the community.
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique was used to determine 15 people who were suspected of carrying the α-thalassemia gene based on their complete blood count. This study identified that there were 12/15 people carrying - -SEA mutation, 1/15 carrier having - α3.7 mutation, 1/15 carrier having - α4.2 mutation and 1/15 person carrying point mutation Hb constant spring - αHbCs.

Histopathology’ s small-intestinal resections due to crohn disease
Three cases of small intestine Crohn disease are observed in bowel resection specimen for perforation or for occlusion during the period April - October 1999 in our AP lab...
The combination of acute blood loss and cancerous condition in patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (rHCC) requires a multi disciplinary approach in management.
The initial objective of management is hemostasis and haemodynamic stability and after that to assessfor the remaining liver function.
In case of unstable hemodynamic conditions, treatments should be considered as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), liver resection or TAE then elective liver resection and those approachs are shown effective.
However, no randomized controlled trial nor well-designed comparative study has been performed to determine the best method for hemostasis.
Most of the evidence comes from cohort studies.
Liver resection is still method of choice in cases where the tumors is rectable cut and located in the peripheral and good critical care settings.
Keywords: Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma, transcatheter arterial embolization, emergency liver resection.

Follow-up time is 6.16 ± 3.59 years.
Both groups had the same improvement in the TR grade (>2+), NYHA and PAPS when assessing at dis-charged time.
For long-term outcomes, tricuspid valve repaired patients had lower risk comparing to unrepaired ones in TR grade >2+, with HR = 0.62 (95% CI, 0: 48 - 0.81 and p = 0.001), NYHA increasing 1 grade with HR = 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48 - 0.92 and p = 0.01) and PAPS increasing > 50 mmHg with HR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 - 0.97 and p = 0.03).
Conclusion: Assessing tricuspid valve treatment efficacy at dis-charge time did not showed the difference between 2 groups (repaired vs unrepaired), but long-term outcomes show the significant difference.
Tricuspid repaired patients had the lower risk of TR severe grade (>2+), NYHA increasing 1 grade and PAPS increasing > 50 mmHg compared to un-repaired ones with statistically significant (p <0.05).
Evaluation of brain mri lesions in dementia
Background: There are many specific types and causes of dementia, often showing slightly different symptoms. However, symptoms usually overlap, and it is impossible to make a diagnosis based on symptoms alone.
All of them had brain MRI abnormalities, including brain atrophy, white matter lesions, vascular lesions and ventricular dilatation.
The rate of severe white matter lesions Fazekas>1 was higher in vascular dementia compared with other dementias.
Small vessel disease was the vascular lesion which was most frequently seen in vascular dementia (100%).
Higher ratings of MTA and PA were associated with lower MMSE. Ventricular dilatation rate was the highest among patients with MMSE score ranging from 0 to 11.
Conclusion: 100% of dementia patients in this study have abnormalities on brain MRI.
Medial temporal atrophy and posterior atrophy were most frequently seen in Alzheimer's patients, but only posterior atrophy distinguished Alzheimer's disease from other dementias.
White matter lesions and small vascular disease play a very important role in vascular dementia.
In addition, the study also showed that severe degree of medial temporal atrophy and posterior atrophy and the presence of ventricular dilatation reflected the severe degree of dementia.
Keywords: medial temporal atrophy, posterior atrophy, Mini Mental State Examination.
Diagnosis may be aided by brain scanning techniques, especially brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the brain MRI lesions in dementia and the patterns of brain MRI lesions in each type of dementia. In addition, the study also investigated relationships between severe degree of some brain MRI lesion patterns and MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) score.
Methods: This was a case - series study.
We conducted a survey on brain MRI in patients with dementia who went for medical examination at the neurological consulting - room or were hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine of University Medical Center in Ho Chi Minh City from November 2012 to April 2013.
Results: 61 patients could be studied. Mean age is 75.75; female ratio is 59%.

Background and purpose: lagre hemispheric infarction (LHI) with neurological deterioration is the first death-causing ischemic stroke in the first week.
Determining early factors selecting the patients helps indicate decompressive hemicraniectomy that decreases the mortality and improves life-quality.
Methods: This is the describing and analyzing prospective trial in LHI patients admitted within 48 hours of symptom onset.
We analysed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and CT parameters following two survival and neurological death groups.
Results: In fifty-seven LHI patients, tweenty two were died of brain swelling and thirty-five were survival.
Logistic regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of fatal brain edema: conscious disorder at the onset (p < 0, 001; OR = 13, 56 với CI 95%: 3, 50 - 52, 63); ventricular compression (p = 0, 01; OR = 15, 5 với CI 95%: 2, 9 - 84, 1); and ASPECTS = 0 (p = 0, 039; OR = 5 với CI 95%: 1, 1 - 23, 4).
ASPECTS = 0 associated with frontal and / or occipital hypodensity (panhemispheric hypodensity) had a predicting significance with specificity 100% and sensitivity 27, 7%.
Conclusions: Patients with conscious disorders (drowsiness, stupor), ventricular compression and ASPECTS = 0 on CT are capable to leading to fatal brain swelling.
The presence of panhemispheric hypodensity is related to neurogical death with high specticity but low sensitivity.
Spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection: case report
Spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (SISMAD) is rare and has a high mortality risk.
There are many classification as well as many treatment options including conservative treatment, endovascular intervention and surgery.
We, therefore, reported on our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of SISMAD and reviewed literature.
In our two cases, there was one case of conservative treatment followed by surgical intervention, a case of successful endovascular intervention.
Conservative treatment with or without anticoagulant is the first choice for the treatment of SISMAD.
Endovascular interventions should be strictly adhered to because there is still a risk.
Surgical intervention is indicated only when bowel necrosis or rupture of the arteries exsists.
Keywords: Spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection.

Patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) have dysregulated immune processes, which can result in an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies.
However, untreated autoimmune disease or chronic tissue damage due to uncontrolled inflammation may cause even equal or greater harm.
Cross-specialty cooperation is invaluable to treat autoimmune diseases in patients with PID.
Keywords: primary immunodeficiency
A wide variety of autoimmune diseases are found in patients with PID such as cytopenias, endocrinopathies, enteropathies or other autoimmune disorders including arthritis, hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, lupus, neurologic diseases, skin diseases and occular involvement.
There is no general tissue or organ restriction, nor is there a gender or age predominance like that seen in autoimmune diseases affecting the general population.
Autoimmunity in patients with PID is believed to be due to a variety of possible underlying mechanisms.
These include: (1) secondary lymphopenia, which permits proliferation and expansion of autoreactive lymphocytic clones, (2) defects of immune tolerance, the state of unresponsiveness to agents that otherwise would elicit an immune response, (3) defects in apoptosis / clearance of apoptotic bodies or cellular debris, (4) hyperactivation of lymphocytes, (5) defects in signaling pathways, (6) defects in early complement components.
When autoimmunity develops before a patient has experienced recurrent infections, the diagnosis of an underlying PID may be neglected and delayed for years.
Two clinical clues that an underlying PID may be present are the development of an autoimmune disorder at an unusually early age and the presence of autoimmune processes that affect multiple organ systems, not necessarily at the same time, and cannot be unified under a single rheumatologic diagnosis.
Most autoimmune diseases in patients with PID are managed with the same therapies used in patients without PID.
In some cases, the treatment required to control the autoimmune process may cause secondary immunodeficiency and further increase the risk of infection or malignancy.

Maternal factors causing hearing loss to children included influenza and fetal derangement.
Fetal factors include low Apgar level, jaundice, oxygenation and orofacial cleft.
Discussion: The results were compared to the article around the world Conclusion: The clarification of deafness in infant is necessary for helping infant.
Timely detection and intervention give children a great opportunity to recuperate their ability to listen, develop language skills, help them to learn, integrate into the community and reduce the burden on the children themselves, their family and the society.
Keywords: Deafness, infant, TEOAR method.
The project "Evaluation of newborn hearing loss screening program in Nguyen Tri Phuong Hospital" hence was conducted to examine the rate of hearing loss occurring in infants using Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) to determine several causes of deafness from mothers and children themselves.
The proportion of male and female infants was approximately equal (50.4% and 49.6%).
Children's age (in days) was 2.85 ± 1.35.
The average fetal age was 38.64 ± 0.034.
Results of the first OAE test: 108 (8%) cases failed the test with 4.6% children had unilateral hearing loss and 3.4% had hearing loss in both sides.
Surgical treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage: report of 63 cases
Background: Hypertensive intracerebral hematoma (ICH) is a serious and potentially lethal condition which needs the intensive care and treatment. The essential is the medical treatment but in some special cases the surgical intervention can ameliorate the prognosis of the disease.
The DSA (Digital subtraction angiography) were performed in some cases, especially in the young patients, to rule out the vascular etiologies such as the AVM or aneurysm.
The time from the onset of stroke to the removal of blood clot: from 24 hours to 8 days.
By many reasons we had not any operative case within the first 24 hours. The surgical approach was individualized on the basis of the site and size of the ICH.
Allowed techniques included conventional open craniotomy and burr hole and placement of a catheter for evacuation of the ICH, with or without stereotactic frame.
Conclusions: The decision about whether and when to operate remains controversial but we find also some points of consensus: Non surgical candidates: Patients with small hemorrhage (< 10 cm3) or minimal neurological deficits should be treated medically; Patients with GCS score £4 should also be treated medically because they uniformly die or have extremely poor functional outcome that cannot be improved by surgery.
In the future, the efficacy of any medical or surgical treatment has yet to be proved in a large multi-center randomized trials.
The authors present their remarks on the result of 63 operative cases in 115 People's hospital from July - 1994 to July - 2003.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of 63 cases of ICH operated on in 10 years (from July-1994 to July-2003).
with 30 supratentorial ICH and 14 infratentorial ICH. There were 19 cases which were operated on using the burr hole and suction technique with Backlund's needle or modified backlund's needle without stereotactic frame, 44 cases which were operated on with conventional open craniotomy techniques.
On admission, all patients underwent a standard neurological examination (GOS: Glasgow Coma Scale) and a computed tomographic scan.
The surgical candidates were chosen with many criteria: antecedent of hypertension, age, site and size of the ICH, patient's neurological status.
Plasma: set up to organize plasma collection and plasma derivatives
Plasma is a component of blood that plays an important role in the survival of the body.
Today with high-tech plasma is also a source of raw materials for the production of recombinant preparations from plasma (plasma fractionnation), they have been widely used around the world.
Plasma derivatives such as: Fresh frozen plasma; Cryoprecipitate-depleted plasma; Virus "inactivated" plasma; Cryoprecipitate rich in factor VIII; Human albumin solusions; Factor VIII concentrate; Factor IX concentrate; Immunoglobulin for intramuscular IMIG; Immunoglobulin is used for intravenous IVIG (intravenous gamaglobulin) injection; Immunoglobulin anti Rh D (Anti-D RhlG).
Currently we are used plasma derivatives with a high cost and they are not always available.
Based on available standards and reference of Vietnam, European and American standards, Regional Blood Transfusion Centers of Vietnam will be to implement plasmapherisis as a source of raw materials for plasma fractionation to prepate drugs, that reduce costs and prevent other risks when dependent on the source of medicine that raw materials from other communities.

Early outcome of surgical treatment of aortic valve stenotic disease
Background: Aortic valve stenosis processes insidously and has high mortality when symptoms develop.
Sokolow-Lyon index reduces from 48.4 mm to 40.8 mm after valve replacement (P<0.001).
13 patients with preoperative low EF improve to 49.9% postoperatively (P<0.001).
Postoperative complications including arrythmia, myocardial infraction, renal failure and infection happened at rate of 12%, 4%, 15%, and 6% respectively.
Operative mortality is 4%. Conclusion: Aortic stenotic disease in elderly patients is usually due to calcification of valves, whereas in young patients it results from biscupid aortic valve.
Most of patients admit to hospital besause of severe heart failure.

Case report: acute fatty liver of pregnancy
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) has an incidence of approximately one in 10000 - 15000 pregnancies, potentially fatal complication that occurs in the third trimester or early postpartum period.
Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, this disease has been linked to an abnormality in fetal fatty acid metabolism.
Early diagnosis of AFLP sometimes can be difficult because it shares features with other common conditions such as pre-eclampsia, viral hepatitis and cholestasis of pregnancy.
However, a careful history and physical examination, in conjunction with compatible laboratory and imaging results, are often sufficient to make the diagnosis, and liver biopsy is rarely indicated.
Supportive care and expeditious delivery are essential to optimal maternal-fetal outcomes and remain as the mainstay treatment for AFLP.

Background: Congenital mitral regurgitation is a rare condition which often remains undiagnosed and scarcely received adequate treatments.
43.3% of the patients were malnourished.
Common complications were pulmonary hypertension (83.3%), heart failure (43.3%), arrhythmia (10%) and death (6.7%).
6 types of congenital mitral valve injury were noted on echocardiogram: leaflet prolapse, annular dilation, abnormal leaflet, commissural fusion, chordae tethering, papillary muscle abnormality.
Leaflet prolapse and annular dilation were the most common types (73.3% and 63.3% respectively).
Type II of mitral regurgitation (according to Carpentier and Mitruka) has the highest percentage (63.3% and 90%).
Severe regurgitation follows ASE guidelines accounted for over half of the cases (60%).
93.3% of patients received treatment with vasodilator (93.3%), diuretics (32.3%), inotropic (16.7%), antiarrhythmic (3.3%).
90% of patients were eligible for surgical interventions but only 13.3% underwent the operation at the appropriate time and criteria; reasons include miss out surgical indications, uncooperative patients that did not follow the regime nor revisit for follow up examinations.
33.3% of the cases were consulted for surgery in which 20% patients have not been operated yet.
Conclusion: Congenital mitral regurgitation patients who did not receive adequate treatment and follow-up have many complications: heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmia, and death.
The affected children bear the burden of severe heart failure for many years, owing to the unrecognized condition, improper non-surgical therapy or delayed surgical intervention, leading to unrecoverable postoperative dilated myocardiopathy and mortality.

Perioperative myocardial cell damage is a major problem during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Conclusion: After CABG, the aortic cross - clamping time is one of several important factors increased the cardiac markers levels.
Serum troponin I and T higher than 69mg / L and 1.39mg / L in 24 hours postoperation of CABG are correlated best with the diagnosis of perioperative MI.
CK-MB has longtime been used to establish a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cTnT are highly specific and sensitive markers of myocardial injury and ischemia.
The aim of this study is to determine whether serum markers of myocardial injury are elevated after CABG surgery and whether their increases are associated with CPB and aortic cross - clamping and to establish threshold values for cTnT and cTnI that strongly suggest substantial myocardial damage and necrosis in 24 hours postoperation.
Method: we studied 330 patients who underwent CABG at Heart Institute of HCM city.
Postoperative troponin I level (165pts), troponin T (165 pts) and CK-MB (330 pts), ECG, clinical data and clinical events were recorded prospectively.
The diagnosis of perioperative MI was defined by a new Q wave on ECG and / or reduced 25% of R wave and / or serum level of the CK-MB higher than 100 UI / L within 12 - 48 hour postoperative.
Results: In this study 29 patients (8.8%) had sustained a perioperative MI according to current diagnosis criteria.
Background: Combination of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs increases gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk.
GI bleeding events accounted for 1.7%.
Risk factors of GI bleeding included history of peptic ulcer OR = 8.8 (1.7 - 45.6), p = 0, 036, Killip IV OR = 13.7 (3.5 - 53.8), p = 0, 001, renal failure during hospitalization OR = 5.6 (1.5 - 21.1), p = 0, 015 and mechanical ventilation OR = 73.7 (14.5 - 374.5), p < 0.0001.
In multivariable analysis, only 2 independent risk factors were found, including history of epigastric pain OR = 17.6 (1.4 - 225.8), p = 0.027 and mechanical ventilation OR = 115.2 (10.5 - 1259.1), p < 0.0001.
Length of hospitalization of patients with GI bleeding was greater than that of patients without GI bleeding (14.7 ± 13.4 days vs 7.5 ± 4.6 days, p < 0.0001).
Patients with GI bleeding had higher mortality rate than patients without GI bleeding (44.4% vs 4.7%, p = 0, 001).
Conclusions: The prevalence of acute GI bleeding in patients with acute MI ater PCI is 1.7%.
Risk factors of GI bleeding include history of epigastric pain and mechanical ventilation.
Patients with GI bleeding have longer hospital stay and higher mortality rate than those without GI bleeding.
Keywords: Gastrointestinal bleeding, acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention
This complication may lead to prolonged hospital stay, higher risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), in-stent thrombosis and mortality.
Meanwhile, there are few researches on this problem.
Objectives: To identify prevalence, characteristics and risk factors of acute GI bleeding, length of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rate of patients with acute MI who develop GI bleeding after PCI.
Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted.
Patients diagnosed with acute MI and underwent PCI at Gia Dinh's People hospital from January 2014 to April 2016 were recruited.
We collected research data from the patients and clinical records, with the use of data sheets.
Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses identify risk factors of GI bleeding in patients with acute MI after PCI.
Results: From January 2014 to April 2016, 516 patients with acute MI were hospitalized and underwent PCI at Gia Dinh's People hospital.

A survey of characteristics of ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms by digital subtraction angiography
Background and purpose: Excluding completely intracranial aneurysms (IAs) from cerebral circulation is the goal of surgical and endovascular treatment.
According to Ratio of sac to neck size (RSN), the narrow and medium neck sizes were 88.4%.
97.5% of RIAs had an uneven edge.
The relationship to the major neighboring artery from RIA was 6.8%.
The aplitic A1 segment at the opposite side for ACA of RIAs was 48.8%.
Cerebral vasospasm after SAH was 28.3%.
No correlation was found between location, RIA size or neck size and the clinical state of the patients.
However, a definite correlation was found between cerebral vasospasm and the clinical state of the patients (Fisher test, p<.001).
Conclusion: Knowledge gained about the characteristics of RIAs by DSA is useful in order to choose methodology of the treatment as well as planning the technical treatment effectively.
The choice of methodology as well as the planning of the treatment is influenced by characteristics of the IAs.
Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for evaluating this condition.
We describe the characteristics of ruptured IA (RIAs) by DSA and find the correlation between the characteristics of RIA with the clinical state of the patients.
Materials and methods: The descriptions of 237 patients definitely diagnosed with RIA by DSA at Cho Ray Hospital from June 2012 to February 2013 were reviewed for this study.
Results: Most of patients were hospitalized with Hunt - Hess from I to III (74.3%).
94.5% of RIAs were from the internal carotid.
Small and medium size RIAs were 97%, only 1.3% were the giant aneurysm.
RIAs of the small neck size were 88.5%.
Background: The traditional practice of prolonged fasting, by ít catabolic action, may increase insulin resistance.
Conclusion: The 2-hour preoperative intake of 400ml maltodextrin 12.5% does not appear to alter the amount of residual gastric volume before the induction of thyroidectomy, suggesting that this is a safe procedure, in terms of aspiration risk.
Furthermore, the intake of such fluid might improve the feeling of thirst preoperatively and 2h - postoperatively.
Keywords: preoperative fasting; carbohydrate loading; maltodextrin; residual gastric volume
2 hour - preoperatively intake of maltodextrin beverage 12.5% instead of fasting is expected to have potential benefits to the metabolism without increasing the risk of aspiration related to residual gastric volume.
Objectives: To compare the residual gastric volume and feeling of thirst between patients ingested maltodextrin beverage and prolong fasted patients.
Methods: In this randomized - controlled trial, sixty patients scheduled for thyroidectomy were assigned to the treatment or control group.
Patients in the treatment group (n=30) received 400 ml maltodextrin 12.5% 2h before the induction.
Conversely, control patients (n=30) underwent fasting of clear fluid over 2h.
Before the induction, the residual gastric volume of two groups was measured by ultrasonography.
Results: There was no statistical difference of residual gastric volume between the two groups (p >0.05).
Protocol for the detection of vaca genotypes and caga gene of helicobacter pylori from gastric biopsies by a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay
We set up a multiplex PCR-based protocol for the detection and genotyping of cagA and vacA genes.
The protocol includes clinical samples selection, DNA extraction, multiplex PCR optimization and sensitivity determination.
The set up protocol was then applied to some gastric cancer and gastritis biopsies.
We showed that this can be a rapid and simple method to detect and genotype H pylori in clinical samples.

The clinical, endoscopic and pathogical characteristics of early-onset colorectal cancer in vietnamese population
Background: The Asia Pacific consensus for colorectal cancer (CRC) recommends that screening program should begin by the age of 50.
Results: The rate of early-onset CRC was 28% (112/400) with the male-to-female ratio of 1.3.
22.3% (25/112) of patients only experienced abdominal pain and / or change in bowel habit without alarming symptoms.
42.9% (48/112) of patients considered their symptoms as intermittent pattern.
The rate of familial history of CRC in early-onset group was significantly higher that of the late-onset group (21.4% versus 7.6%, p<0.001).
The distribution of CRC lesions in rectum, distal and proximal colon were 51.8% (58/112), 26.8% (30/112) and 21.4% (24/112), respectively; which was not different from that in the late-onset group (c2, p = 0.29).
The rates of poorly differentiated tumor were also not significantly different between the two groups: 12.4% (14/112) in early-onset group versus 8.3% (24/288) in late-onset group (c2, p = 0.25).
Conclusion: A high proportion of CRC appeared at an earlier age than that recommended for screening by the Asia Pacific consensus.
Family history was a risk factor of early-onset CRC.

Introduction: Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for pancreatic head cancer for improvement of patient survival.
The postoperative mortality rate was 2.4%.
The mean overall survival time was 12.35 ± 1.36 months; survival rate after 2 years is 20.3%.
Factors such as resection of pancreatic head tumor, no lymph node metastasis, and no distant metastasis all increased the patients survival time (p<0.05) Conclusion: Surgical treatment of pancreatic head cancer is feasible and safe; and pancreaticoduodenectomy increase the patients survival time Keywords: pancreatic head cancer, whipple procedure, pancreaticoduodenectomy
Studies in Vietnam have focused less on survival after surgery.
Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of pancreatic head cancer at Viet Duc Hospital.
Patients and methods: A Retrospective study of patients with pancreatic head cancer have been operated at Viet Duc University Hospital from 01/2014 to 12/2015.
Results: There were 83 pancreatic head cancer patients operated at Viet Duc hospital.
The mean age was 57.7 ± 11.5 (age), male and female were 57.8% and 42.2%, respectively.
18.1% of patients had malnutrition before surgery; The rate of tumor resection (Whipple procedure) was 57.9%.
The rate of bypass was 36.1%, the rate of exploratory surgery was 6%.
The postoperative complications were bleeding, pancreatic leak, Choledochojejunostomy leak accounted for 6%; 3.6% and 1.2%, respectively.

3.3.3 Surgical parameters and related to the preoperative condition Reconstruct some assessment of atrioventricular valve abnormalities at surgery compared with preoperative echocardiography - Surgeons agreed with the diagnosis of partial AVSD: 100%.
- There was a high agreement on the rate of diagnosis of cleft of MR (97% ultrasound and 94% surgeon).
The value of echocardiography in diagnosing some atrioventricular valve abnormalities 17 Table 3.36. Value of echocardiogram in the diagnosis of atrioventricular valve abnormalities Parameter Cleft of MV Dilatation ring of MV Cleft of TV Hypoplasia of septal TV Sensitivity 98 2, 4 66.6 29, 2 Specificity 25 96 79, 7 88, 5 Predictive positive value 98, 4 50 13, 3 80 Negative predictive value 50 38 98 44 The results show that: assessing MV abnormalities had high sensitivity and positive predictive value.
Evaluate clinical, subclinical and morphologica l, fuctional cardiac changes after surgery in patients with partial AVSD 2.
The techniques used for repairing MV and repairing TV: close of cleft MV was the most common (94%), for TV, the most used techniquewas the De Vega method (49.3%).
The relationship assessment showed that the degree of MR, TR before surgery was closely related to the number of methods used to repair valves.
Analysis of the relationship of preoperative systolic PAP with the perioperative: there was a close relationship with the time of mechanical ventilation, the higher of pre-operative PAPs, the longer the mechanical ventilation would last.
But no association was found between the degree of preoperative MR and the surgical period.
Summary of some short-term treatment results Parameters Patients (n) Percent (%) Discharge 67 100 Reoperation 2 3, 0 18 Permanent pacemaker implant 1 1, 5 Temporary pacemaker implant 4 6, 0 Discharge to die at home 0 0 Death 0 0 Evaluation of treatment results based on criteria of reducing MR, PAPs or both: there was a clear improvement (comparing the time 1 week - 1 month after surgery with preoperation): the degree of MR well reduced after 1 week - 1 month surgery was 73.1% and 82.7%, respectively; similar to the reduction in systolic PAPs 1 week - 1 month of 89.4% and 90.4%, respectively; combining these two criteria, the ratio was 61.2% and 73.1%, respectively.
Some complications during and after surgery: no premature death, BAV III rate was 11.9% but 6/8 cases recovered to sinus before discharge, in addition to the rate of pneumonia - bronchopneumonia accounting for 17.9%, heart failure 7.5% and some other complications.
CHAPTER 4 DISCUSS 4.1 General characteristics of the study patient group Patient age: the late detection of congenital heart disease was a feature of our current socio-economic conditions.
A study of 40 years of partial AVSD surgery at the Mayo Clinic, the median age of patients was 9.6 years, 6.1 years and 7.2 years, respectively during the 50s, 70s and 80s.
4.3 Clinical, subclinical and morphological changes, cardiac function after surgery in the study patient group 4.3.1 Clinical changes after surgery 19 4.3.1.1 Changes in functional signs: There was a statistically significant change in functional signs before and after surgery (dyspnea NYHA II, III before surgery accounted for 58.2%, 100% at NYHA I at any time postoperative), this result was similar to the result of the author Dao Quang Vinh and some other authors.
This showed an improvement in patients after surgery regardless of age.
4.3.2.2 Change of physical signs: - There was a clear change in heart auscultation, the rate of systolic murmur of MR and TR were recorded to decrease much compared to before surgery.
MR after surgery was the leading cause of the re-surgery of patients with partial AVSD, the new appearance or the increase of MR murmur would be a sign that suggested the next indications to be done for evaluation (echocardiography).
- A strong, splitting T2 sound did not appear after surgery (showing a significant decrease in blood flow to the lungs, a significant reduction in PAP).
4.3.2 Subclinical changes after surgery 4.3.2.1 Change of some subclinical characteristics Chest X Ray Cardiothoracic ratio, signs of increased pulmonary circulation and significant decreased PAP after surgery indirectly showed that pulmonary vascular disease was not a problem of the patient in this study.
ECG There were no significant changes with most of the basic parameters except for a significantly lower heart rate compared to before surgery.
Particularly 5 cases of atrial fibrillation before surgery were over 40 years old, 2 patients had sinus rhythm after surgery.
This wasreally important for the patient, as atrial fibrillation was the 20 premise of the risk of stroke.
There were 2 cases of BAV III with permanent pacemaker (3%), lower than some other studies reported by Di Mambro et al. 7.5%.
+ Chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic ratio and increased pulmonary circulation suggestive of left to right shunt flow.
4.3.2.2 Changes in echocardiography characteristics after surgery Some basic parameters Longitudinal follow-up showed a significant change in the LV end-diastolic diameter (Dd) which was greater than before surgery, in contrast, the RV end-diastolic diameter was smaller before surgery and there was no significant change in the EF index.
Our results were similar to those reported by Nguyen Thi Mai Ngoc and author Dao Quang Vinh.
There was no left-right shunt after surgery to help reduce the volume and pressure RV, so it did not affect ventricular septal and left ventricle.
Left ventricular systolic function remained within normal range before surgery and along the time of follow-up, as the study of author Dao Quang Vinh showed that surgery did not adversely affect heart function.
Characteristics of MR and TR after surgery The rate of MR severe was high before surgery and decreased significantly after surgery.
Three patients with severe MR at 3 months, 6 months were> 50 years old and 2 of them had atrial fibrillation before surgery.
+ ECG: there are some typical signs such as left axis (62.7%), incomplete right bundle branch block (67.2%).
Stulak et al's study showed that the reoperation time was about 10 years.
We therefore need to continue 21 monitoring and evaluating the progression of MR with echocardiography.
Repair of TR also achieved good results, similar to the research results of author Dao Quang Vinh, author Waqar et al.
Results in terms of hemodynamics In our study, it showed a significant decrease of PAP compared to before surgery at all times with median PAPs value at the time before surgery, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months after surgery and 6 months, respectively, 43.4 - 25 - 26 and 25 mmHg and at all ages.
Thus the surgical effect was seen in patients of all age groups, young or old.
Limitations of the study: - Small sample size: 67 patients, the age of patients scattered.
- Short-term vertical follow up.
- Some other diagnostic imaging methods have not been applied (such as real-time 3D esophageal echocardiography).
CONCLUSION 1 Clinical, subclinical and echocardiography characteristics in patients with partial AVSD 1.1 Clinical characteristics - Median age: 192 months (male / female ratio: 1/1.16), patients over 16 years accounted for 49.3%.
Common function signs were shortness of breath with NYHA II accounting for 56.7%.
+ Echocardiography: characterized by the presence of the primum ASD (100%) in combination with cleft of anterior mitral valve (97%).
- Physical signs: detected murmur of MR was 88.1% and murmur of TR was 53.7%.
The splitted S2 at pulmonary valve location were 46.3% and 23.9%, respectively.
1.2 Subclinical characteristics - Chest X-ray: 94.0% with cardiothoracic ratio ≥ 50%, 49.3% with increased pulmonary circulation.
- ECG: 91% of sinus rhythm, 7.5% of atrial fibrillation, 1.5% of BAV III.
The left axis accounted for 62.7%, uncomplete right bundle branch block was 67.2% and BAV I was 34.3%.
1.3 Doppler echocardiography characteristics: unified the diagnosis to identify a partial AVSD with the diagnosis of 100% surgeons.
- 100% had the large primum ASD (unique atrial ASD type rate is 9%).
- 97% had cleft of MV.
The increase in pulmonary pressure was proportional to the diameter of the ASD and the degree of pulmonary pressure was closely related to the time of mechanical ventilation after surgery.
- 86.6% had moderate - severe MR.
The degree of MR was related to the techniques used to repair valve.
- 79.1% had moderate - severe TR.
The degree of TR is related to the techniques used to repair valve.
- The diagnostic value of cleft MV was highly sensitive (98%) as well as the positive predictive value (98.4%) - HTAP with PAPs median was 43.3 mmHg.
The level of HTAP was related to the age and diameter of ASD and was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation.
No more murmur of TR recorded.
2.2 Subclinical and morphological, function cardiac changes after surgery - Chest X-ray showed a clear improvement: cardiothoracic ratio ≥ 50% accounting for 94% pre surgery 1 month after surgery accounted for 32.7%.
- ECG: 2 cases transferred atrial fibrillation to sinus, 2 cases BAV III irreversibly (3%).
2.3 Changes in morphology and cardiac function according to Doppler echocardiography parameters after surgery There was a clear improvement immediately after surgery and maintained up to 6 months with some key parameters as follows: - 100% no residual ASD.
- Severe MR decreased from 65.7% 7.7%.
No more severe TR.
- PAPs significantly decreased from 43.3 25 mmHg.
REQUEST Based on the research results, we have the following recommendations: 1.
Many patients in the study were found to be above the age of 16, much higher than the age recommended for surgery for a variety of reasons.
When patients have signs of suspected CHD with increased pulmonaryperfusion diagnostic echocardiography is 24 required.
The degree of valve regurgitation is proportional to number of valve repair techniques.
At the same time, the degree of atrioventricular valve regurgitation, or the degree of preoperative HTPA are prognostic parameters, therefore they also need to be fully and accurately assessed by echocardiography.
However, the detailed assessment of MV and TV anatomical lesion by transthoracic echocardiography still havs some certain limitations, we need to learn and apply new diagnostic methods to improve the diagnosis.
Thus, we can be assured to surgery for these patients unless contraindication.
Transthoracic echocardiography is a simple, inexpensive, easy-to-use diagnostic tool to evaluate treatment results and long - term follow-up.

CHAPTER I OVERVIEW 1.1 Basic knowledge about partial AVSD 1.1.1 History of research and embryology, anatomical abnormalities of partial AVSD In 1846, AVSD was first described by Peacock, the lesion identification was incomplete atrial and ventricular septal wall.
In 1875, Rokitansky was the one who used the term complete and partial to describe this pathology.
4 The anatomical standard of partial AVSD is primum ASD and cleft of anterior leaf mitral valve (few cases do not have).
Partial AVSD has separated mitral valve and tricuspide valve with separated and complete valve rings.
1.1.3 Pathophysiology of partial AVSD Because of anatomical abnormalities, many patients with AVSD have one or more of the following disorders: shunt via ASD, left and right atrioventricular valve regurgitation.
Without surgery, about 15% of untreated patients will develop pulmonary vascular disease and atrial fibrillation in adolescence.
1.1.4 Diagnosis of partial AVSD 1.1.4.1 Diagnosis of partial AVSD The clinical manifestations of the partial AVSD change and are related to hemodynamic changes.
Clinical symptoms often appear late with the symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue.
Physical signs: a systolic murmur due to increased flow through the pulmonary valve, the seconde sound of pulmonary valve is loud and splited (prolonging the pulmonary component of the T2).
In addition, the systolic murmur of MR or TR can be heard.
1 INTRODUCTION OF THE DISSERTATIONPREAMBLE AVSD (atrioventricular septal defect) is an anomal characterized by a lack of atrioventricular septal wall with a variety of abnormalities of the atrioventricular valves.
1.1.4.2 Paraclinical partial AVSD Chest X ray Right ventricular and pulmonary arterylobes are usuallydilated and there is signs of increased pulmonary perfusion.
ECG Classically, the ECG has a left axis with angles from 0 to - 900.
Signs of right ventricular hypertrophy with rsR'in the precordial leads.
Left precordial leads or qRs or qRS reflect the degree of right ventricular hypertrophy.
Right bundle branch block is also common.
5 Doppler echocardiography Echocardiography allows to identify and classify the AVSD morphology.
In addition to assess morphological changes, echocardiography also evaluates changes in hemodynamic adn functional parameters.
Atrioventricular valve morphology: mitral valve and tricuspide valve are on the same plane, mitral valve leaves and tricuspide leaves cling to the tip of the ventricular septum, with 2 separate atrioventricular valve holes.
Cleft of atrioventricular valve: the subcostal view, the parasternal short axis view and apical four-chamber view provide a clear view of the atrioventricular valves.
Cleft of anterior mitral valve directly toward to the inlet ventricular septum.
Variation in the left ventricular outlet: the anteriorly aortic shift, not wedged between the MV and TV loop, causes the aorta anterior to the atrioventricular junction which may cause LVOTO.
Characteristics of the primum ASD: Focal are seen extending to the atrioventricular valve, no atrioventricular segment, size varies but often is wide.
Several other combined characteristics: The extension of the LVOT with the ratio of outlet / inlet > 1.
Counter-clockwise displacement of the MV chordare.
The balance / imbalance of the two ventricles and the two atriums.
And some other abnormalities can be seen (ventricular dysplasia, stenosis of the RVOT) Hemodynamic and functional parameters Echocardiographic parameters include: left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, degree of MR, TR, ASD shunt, PAP and pulmonary flow (Qp), aortic flow (Qs).
6 The above parameters can be assessed simply and accurately by Doppler echocardiography and can be repeated many times, safely and inexpensively.
In the world, the basic knowledge about the disease as well as the treatment of surgery have been studied for a long time.
In 1954, Lillehei and co-workers successfully carried out the first partial AVSD repair surgery with the good results.
The study of Hani K Najm collected data of 180 childrens who had surgery to repair of partial AVSD from 7/1982 to 12/1996 in Canada, the average age was 3.6 years (1 month - 16.4 years).
The short term death rate is 1.6%.
Other complications: atrial arrhythmia, transient atrioventricular block soon after surgery.
The average postoperative follow up time with echocardiography was 4.6 ± 3.6 years (2 months - 13.7 years) showed that ASD residual shunts accounted for 1%, mild (or no), moderate and severe MR were 85%, 14% and 1% respectively.
Research of Krupickova et al. (2000 - 2015) on 51 symptomatic patients with partial and transitional AVSD with mean age of 179 days (0 - 357 days), of which 31% of patients had severe valve anomalies.
The in hospital death rate was 5.9%, 22% of patients had to undergo re-surgery (4 days - 5.1 years), 1 patient had to replace mechanical valve.
Multivariate analysis showed that unfavorable anatomical status of MV is an independent risk factor for reoperation MV.
Besides, the study of Barnett and colleagues on adult patients (from 13 - 65 years old, the average age is 48 years old), with a Qp / Qs ratio of 3.9 (from 2.4 to 4.4) showed no deaths during hospital stay, improved heart failure through NYHA postoperative evaluation of patients.
This suggests the safety and the effect of partial AVSD 7 surgeryand should be recommended for all patients to prevent changes in morphology and cardiac function.
The appropriate time for surgical treatment as well as long-term results are issues that have been interested and studied by many authors around the world.
1.2.2 Studies in Vietnam In Vietnam, there is a lot of difficulty in early diagnosistherefore many patients come for treatment at high age compared to the recommended age of operation.
Le Thi Thanh Xuan and Nguyen Tan Vien published research results on ehocardiography of morphology and hemodynamics in children with AVSD.
The results showed that the complete AVSD accounted for 71.6%, the rest was partial AVSD; 44% had atrioventricular valve regurgitation, of which none had severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation, 48% had pulmonary hypertesion, 11% had other combined heart defects.
Research of Bui Duc Phu and Le Ba Minh Du at Hue Central Hospital on surgical results of 17 cases of AVSD from 1/2000 to 6/2005.
There are no death related surgery, the atrioventricular valve regurgitation improved.
Most recently (in 2015), Dao Quang Vinh conducted a study to evaluate the results of partial AVSD surgery.
The study included 89 patients, the early and first 6-month mortality rate accounted for 1.1%, 1.1% severe MR need to be reoperated.
The severity of MR decreased and heart failure improved.
CHAPTER 2 SUBJECTS AND METHODS OF THE STUDY 2.1 Object of research Including 67 patients, diagnosed with partial AVSD and had indication for operation at Hanoi Heart Hospital.
The period was from January 2011 to December 2014.
The rate of reoperation is still high of 10 - 25%, depending on each the center, mainly due to the progression of MR (mitral valve regurgitation) or LVOTO (left ventricular ouflow tract obstruction).

Determine the rate of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with chronic urticaria and clinical relevance of the disease.
In 2015, Huiyuan Gu analyzed 16 studies found that the rate of H pylori infection in chronic urticaria is 49, 74% higher in the control group. The difference indicates that H pylori infection may be a risk factor for developing chronic urticaria, increasing the risk of chronic urticarial.
Regarding the duration time of symptom, 59.6% of patients had the duration time lasting> 6 hours, in which, the rate of CU / H.

This point is significantly lower than before treatment (p (1) (3) < 0, 05) and the lowest among 3 groups, the difference was significant with p12 <0.05; p13 <0.05.
Fukuda's study found that among patients with H pylori positive, microbial eradicated, 35% of patients had complete remission and 65% had partial remission of urticaria symptoms.
Disease control After 3 months treatment cessation, the rate patients well - controlled disease of the CU / H.
pylori+ eradicated group was (36, 8%), significantly higher than the CU / H.
In 2018, Robert Pawowicz reported a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of H pylori eradication treatment in patients with CU which was significantly effective but only temporary.
Through analyzing reports in the literature, it might be the following reasons: Firstly, is that bacteria can act as an irritant of pathophysiological processes leading to the CU?
Antibody production may continue even after the H pylori eradication, contributing to the interpretation of cases with urticaria infected H pylori, eradication of bacteria, but still urticaria expression.
Secondly is that the deteriorating clinical condition has been identified as possibly due to bacterial infection.
22 CONCLUSION Through a study of 245 patients of chronic urticaria who were treated at Hai Phong University Medical Hospital from 8/2016 - 02/2018, the thesis has some main conclusions: 1.
The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with chronic urticaria and clinical relevance of the disease.
This score was significantly lower than before treatment and compared with the other two groups.
Before treatment, CU-QoL score of the CU / H.
Determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with chronic urticaria and clinical relevance of the disease.
Effective treatment of chronic urticaria is evaluated by the Urticaria Control Test (UCT).
Many studies on the role of H pylori in chronic urticaria have been conducted and proposed some theories to explain the relationship between H pylori infection and chronic urticaria: Firstly, some protein components of H pylori may play a role in mast cell activation causing chronic urticaria.
Secondly, bacteria act as full and self-allergenic antigens, causing an immune response.
IgG and IgA antibodies associated with 19-kDa of H pylori lipoproteins have been found to play a role in CU.
Thirdly, some inflammatory mediators have been released during the immune response to H pylori infection, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of urticaria, at least to create out of nonspecific hypersensitivity of skin vessels with substances that enhance vasodilation.
Finally, the process of bacterial infection reduces the barrier function of the gastrointestinal mucosa, facilitating allergy food particles into the blood.
H pylori may also increase the amount of eosinophil cationic protein with a toxin secreted by eosinophilic activation that contributes to chronic urticaria.

Objective 1: The improvements of circulation, arterial blood gas, organ function 3.2.1.
Objective 2: Some prognostic factors of mortality and complications of VA-ECMO 3.3.1.
1 INTRODUCTION Myocarditis is defined as an inflammation of the myocardium with the most reason caused by virus.
Some prognostic factors of mortality - The survival rate was 82.14% 3.3.1.1.
Cardiac arrest associated with mortality rate Table 3.7: Cardiac arrest associated with mortality rate Survival (n=44) Non-survival (n=10) OR CI-95% Cardiac arrest 11 (25%) 7 (70%) 7.14 0.03 - 0.65 Non - cardiac arrest 33 (75%) 3 (30%) Remark: The mortality rate in cardiac arrest patients was 7, 14 times as many as the mortality rate in non-cardiac arrest patients.
3.3.1.2. Pulse pressure associated with mortality rate Table 3.8: Pulse pressure associated with mortality rate on day 5 Survival n (%) Non-survival n (%) OR CI-95% Pulse pressure on day 5 (mmHg) >20 31 (96.8) 1 (3.2) 12.5 0.01 - 0.8 <=20 10 (71.4) 4 (27.8) Remark: The mortality of patients having pulse pressure less than 20 mmHg on ECMO day 5 was 12.5 times higher than patients having pulse pressure greater than 20 mmHg 16 Chart 3.4: SAVE and serum lactat associated with mortality Remark: SAVE score with cut-off - 8 point having sensitivity 87%, specificity 90% and AUC 0.934 for mortality prediction 3.3.2.
17 Chart 3.5: Lower limb arterial thrombosis complication Remark: Lower limb arterial thrombosis complication during stopped ECMO was twice as many as after the arterial thrombosis complication stopped ECMO.
Characteristics 54 acute myocarditis patients with mean age 35.6 (min 13-max 67), 31 - 50 range having 57.4%, and female accounted for 66.7%, the results was similar to the other authors. Almost acute myocardisits patients were female, some studies showed that the male-female ratio may be different but young people suffered from acute myocarditis higher than the elder did.
The severe acute myocarditis such as fluminant myocarditis can lead to cardiogenic shock, life threatening arryhythmia and death.
18 The results showed that almost patients with cardiogenic shock complicated multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS), their APACHE II, SOFA score and serum lactate were 10.3 5.45, 7.8 2.68, 7.6 4.47 mmol / l, respectively.
The high serum lactate concentration reflected the severe cardiogenic schock leading tissue hypoperfusion.
The ECMO duration and number of ECMO membrance ECMO duration in this study was 7.6 2.9 days, one patient did not respone, did not maintain blood pressure and died that only supported ECMO more than one day.
Subgroup analysis showed that 34 patients (63%), 17 patients (31.4%) and 3 patient were supported less than 7 days, from 8 - 14 days, greater than 14 days respectively.
According to these results, the ECMO duration of nearly two third acute myocarditis patients within one week.
With the unrespond patients, the more use vasopressors and inotropic drugs, the more oxygen demand of myocardium that make the heart injury unrecoverable and the patients die.
Objective 1: The improvements of circulation, arterial blood gas, organ function 4.2.1.
The improvements of circulation Desipte high dose vasopressor with median 70 μg / kg / minute, mean arterial pressure's patients before ECMO 62.4 24.60 mmHg.
After ECMO, mean arterial pressure (MAP) incresased significantly that was 76.79.93 mmHg.
19 Before ECMO the serum lactate concentration median was 7.55 mmol / l and markedly decreased on day 2 with median 1.9 mmol / l which demostrated better tissue perfusion and higher MAP.
There were 18 ventricular arrhythmia patients (33.3%), 3 ventricular extrasystole patients, 11 third-degree AV block patients (20.4%) and 22 sinus rhythm patients on admission.
It mean that nearly a half patients having life threatening arrhythmia.
The median of Troponin T profoundly decreased from 4409.0 ng / L on admission to 259.0 ng / L on stopped ECMO day. It reflected that the myocardial necrosis was deacreasing.
Peripheral veno arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a form of cardiopulmonary life support, where blood is drained from the venous system (inferior vena cava or superior vena cava) circulated outside the body by a centrifugal pump, and went through oxygenator for oxygenating and CO2 eliminating then reinfused into the circulation throughout arterial system (most common abdominal arotic artery). Thanks to VA - ECMO stopped vicious circle of pathogenesis and waiting of myocardial recovery.
The improvement of arterial blood gas Before ECMO, because of severe cardiogenic shock arterial blood gas was severe metabolic acidosis with pH 7.30.14, PaCO2 32.614.3 mmHg và HCO3 16.14.88 mmol / l, the metabolic acidosis sharply improved from ECMO day 2.
The improvement of organ function In this study, Having been 7.82.68 before ECMO, SOFA score did not change sifnificantly during ECMO, even slightly increased because of the two things, the first if the patients had acute kidney injury, they need severe weeks for recovering, the second before ECMO the patient's platelet was 19271.2 G / l, after ECMO support, the platelet was 11146.0 G / l on ECMO day 2 and 8943.3G / l on stopped ECMO day, however after one day 20 SOFA score rapidly declined with mean 4.52.31 owing to improved cardiovascular and coagulation score 4.3.1.
Some prognostic factors of mortality The survival rate was 82.14%, it was higher than the other author's rate.
Some complications of VA-ECMO 4.3.2.1.
Bleeding complications In this study, the ECMO cannula bleeding complication on ECMO day 2, day 4 and on stopped ECMO day were 37%, 61.5% 21 and 51.8% respectively. The lower rate of bleeding complication was arterial line site that was 18.5% on ECMO day 2 and 46.2% on stopped ECMO day, while the lowest rate was central line site, 12.5% on ECMO day 5.
Lower limb arterial thrombosis complication In our study, No severe lower limb arterial thrombosis complication during ECMO that need intervention, however 5 cases whom had lower limb arterial thrombosis after stopped ECMO by ultrasound was treated by anticoagulant agents.
Nowadays, the studies showed that VA-ECMO has efficacy on acute myocarditis with the 60 - 70% survival rate.
Acute pulmonary edema and neurologic complications 16 patients (29.6%) had acute pulmonary edema found by clinical signs such as bloody frothy sputum through out endotube, it may be involve left ventricle distension because during VA ECMO, the arterial outflow cannula generates retrograde flow towards the AV, resulting in higher afterload and increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure.
For markedly decreased ejection fraction patients, VA-ECMO can cause increased left ventricle wall tension and myocardial oxygen demand that made more severe acute pulmonary edema and more severe outcome.
In our study, only 1 patient had cerebral infraction, however it is certain that 44 survival patients (81.5%) without sneurologic 22 sequelae so we can completely ruled out neurologic in these patients. The remaining 9 death patients, we could not rule out whether the patient had a neurologic complications event or not because of patient's severe condition that did not allow performed brain CT scan.
CONCLUSION With 54 VA-ECMO supported acute myocarditis patients, our study showed that: 1 / The improvements of circulation, arterial blood gas, organ function VA-ECMO helped improve circulation parameters, arterial blood gas, organ function in acute myocarditis patients.
In Viet Nam, there have been a fews studies about this issue, therefor we perfrom the study: Research on circulation support effects of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in treatmenting acute myocarditis patients with two objectives: 1.
- The improvement of arterial blood gas: Metabolic acidosis was 23 tremendous improved after ECMO, pH before ECMO and stopped ECMO day were 7.300.14 and 7.440.12 respectively (p<0.05).
VA-ECMO should be appied for acute myocarditis patients complicated cardiogenic shock, life threatening arryhythmias and carefully considered in cardiac arrest patients 2.

CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 1.
ACUTE MYOCARDITIS 1.1.
Acute myocaditis account for 6% cause cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentations of the disease range from nonspecific systemic symptoms that it resolves spontaneously to fulminant cardiogenic shock, life threatening arryhythmia and cardiac arrest.
Based on observations of acute myocarditis due to coxsackie virus in humans as well as in mice, acute myoarditis caused by virus is a continuum of distinct disease processes including 3 phases.
The first phase is viral infection and replication in myocardium.
Viral proteolysis and cytokine activation cause myocardial damage leading apotosis.
It is difficult to recognise this phase by clinical sign because of the patients having asymptomatic or unspecific clinical.
The second phase involving the host's immune activation, it simulates cellular and humoral immune responses that reduces viral replication leading to myocardial recovery.
However, immune activation is not decreasing possibly due to the activation of Tcells against myocardium throughout the peptides of viruses.
This leading to release cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, and IL - 6 resulting in more myocardium damage.
Overactivation of cellular immunity or viruses are not completedly eliminated and continue replicating leading the third phase.
This phase, left ventricle was enlarged due to remodeling phenomenon, it causes left ventricle 4 function disorder and heart failure.
If the inflammatory decreases, the left ventricle function will improved but the continuing inflammatory leading to dilated cardiomyopathy.
Respiratory support: depend on patients that need nasal cannula, mask cannula, non invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation.
Mechanical circulatory support Mechanical circulatory support is indicated if the cardiogenic shock patients did not response with conventional treatment.
The advantage of ECMO system can setup quickly, bedside for supporting patients for some weeks.
The survival rate in Matsumoto study 70.2% (26 of 37 patients), four of fifteen unweaned group switched from VA - ECMO to left ventricle assist device were survival after heart tranplantation or continuous treatment.
Aoyama study revealed the survival rate was 57.7% and EF before ECMO and acute kidney injury complication of the mortality group were more severe.
The survival rate of Diddle study was 61%, but the patients having acute kidney injury had higher mortality with OR 3.6, CI 1.4 - 9.3, CI 95%.
According to X Liao, 78.8% surviaval rate, before ECMO serum lactate concentration was very high. The patients having high quantities of blood product transfusion, renal failure, encephalorrhagia, high bilirubin levels, or multiple organ failure (MOF) during ECMO were associated with poor outcome.
Wigfield study found that main factor caused death in VA-ECMO patients was MOF.

However, bacteria can acquire drug resistance by mutating the bacterial target the antibiotic is directed against, inactivating the drugs or pumping them out.
"We reasoned that harnessing the immune system to simultaneously attack bacteria on two different fronts makes it hard for them to develop resistance," said Dotiwala.
He and colleagues focused on a metabolic pathway that is essential for most bacteria but absent in humans, making it an ideal target for antibiotic development.
This pathway, called methyl-D-erythritol phosphate (MEP) or non-mevalonate pathway, is responsible for biosynthesis of isoprenoids - - molecules required for cell survival in most pathogenic bacteria.
The lab targeted the IspH enzyme, an essential enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis, as a way to block this pathway and kill the microbes.
Given the broad presence of IspH in the bacterial world, this approach may target a wide range of bacteria.
Researchers used computer modeling to screen several million commercially available compounds for their ability to bind with the enzyme, and selected the most potent ones that inhibited IspH function as starting points for drug discovery.
Since previously available IspH inhibitors could not penetrate the bacterial cell wall, Dotiwala collaborated with Wistar's medicinal chemist Joseph Salvino, Ph D, professor in The Wistar Institute Cancer Center and a co-senior author on the study, to identify and synthesize novel IspH inhibitor molecules that were able to get inside the bacteria.
The team demonstrated that the IspH inhibitors stimulated the immune system with more potent bacterial killing activity and specificity than current best-in-class antibiotics when tested in vitro on clinical isolates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including a wide range of pathogenic gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
In preclinical models of gram negative bacterial infection, the bactericidal effects of the IspH inhibitors outperformed traditional pan antibiotics.
All compounds tested were shown to be nontoxic to human cells.
"Immune activation represents the second line of attack of the DAIA strategy," said Kumar Singh, Ph D, Dotiwala lab postdoctoral fellow and first author of the study.
"We believe this innovative DAIA strategy may represent a potential landmark in the world's fight against AMR, creating a synergy between the direct killing ability of antibiotics and the natural power of the immune system," echoed Dotiwala.

Wistar Institute scientists have discovered a new class of compounds that uniquely combine direct antibiotic killing of pan drug-resistant bacterial pathogens with a simultaneous rapid immune response for combatting antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
These finding were published today in Nature.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared AMR as one of the top 10 global public health threats against humanity.
It is estimated that by 2050, antibiotic-resistant infections could claim 10 million lives each year and impose a cumulative $100 trillion burden on the global economy.
The list of bacteria that are becoming resistant to treatment with all available antibiotic options is growing and few new drugs are in the pipeline, creating a pressing need for new classes of antibiotics to prevent public health crises.
"We took a creative, double-pronged strategy to develop new molecules that can kill difficult-to-treat infections while enhancing the natural host immune response," said Farokh Dotiwala, M B.B S, Ph D, assistant professor in the Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center and lead author of the effort to identify a new generation of antimicrobials named dual-acting immuno-antibiotics (DAIAs).
Existing antibiotics target essential bacterial functions, including nucleic acid and protein synthesis, building of the cell membrane, and metabolic pathways.

Laws and current utilization of hormones in agricultural production in Vietnam and some other countries-effects of hormone residues in foods on human health.
There have been lots of studies confirming a close correlation between the use of food with hormone residues and life threatening diseases.
A number of substances such as anti-thyroid substances (tapazol, 4 (6) - R-thiouracil), β-agonist (clenbuterol), diethylstilbestrol have been used as growth stimulants.
The natural hormones such as estradiol, testostrogene, progesterol... acted as sexual hormones.

English summary: Most countries over the world have food laws or ordinances in order to protect consumers' health.
Food laws have been established in many countries a long time ago. They have been specified by regulations and decrees on the use of toxic substances in general and hormones in particular in food production.
In Vietnam, the National Assembly has issued the legislation 55/2010/QH12 that monitors the use of weight gain substances, growth stimulants, food preservatives... However, the utilization of hormones in livestock and crops appears complicated and difficult to control.
In developed countries, the European Union for instance, hormones were used since 1980 but due to the strict laws, the utilization has been becoming less than in Asian countries. In Vietnam, due to the illegal import of hormones such as β-agonist and toxic substances from China and other adjacent countries, their utilization has on the rise, leading to food insecurity and negatively effecting the production of meat and vegetables of farmers.

Metabolic syndrome and nutrition.
Development of atherosclerosis generally takes more than a decade without any obvious signals for "healthy" working people in our community.
Therefore, the evaluation of accumulated risk for atherosclerosis with, if necessary, immediate intervention for it is important for the prevention of serious events.
The disorders in lipids, glucose and blood pressure is caused by insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome.
The reduced insulin sensitivity is based on adipocyte dysfunction, which is characterized by secretion of a inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α secretion is included by excess of fat intake.
High fat intake changes 30% of visceral adipocytes to the TNF-α expressing adipocytes in an animal model.
Thus, nutritional control has become much emphasized for the prevention of metabolic syndrome.
The management of nutrition, practicularly excess fat intake, is now expected to effectively prevent the development of atherosclerosis, not only in United States and Japan, but also possibly in Vietnam.
English summary: Concept of metabolic syndrome became popular in many countries in a couple of years.
The fact surprising us is the high frequency of metabolic syndrome; the frequency in men over 40 y. o. is estimated to be 20 - 30% in Japan.
The common feature is characterized by co-existence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and central obesity (visceral fat accumulation), even though each degree of abnormality may be mild.
The subjects with metabolic syndrome are considered to be at high risk for development of atherosclerosis.

Study on antimicrobial activities of aminoreductone.
English summary: Maillard reaction is significant for foods because it strongly affects the quality and acceptance.
In this study, antimicrobial activities of aminoreductone (AR), a product formed during the initial stage of the Maillard reaction, were screened against food-spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and compared to the effects of common antibiotics (amikacin (AN), ciprofloxacin (CIP), meropennem (MEM) and levofloxacin (LVX)).
The inhibitory effects of AR against all 7 isolates were examined by the standard disc diffusion methods, which are widely used to study the bioactivity of chemical compounds.
The inhibition zone for each isolate by AR (2.5 mg) was from 15±0 mm (Bacillus cereus ATCC® 13061™) to 28.25±0.35 mm (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC® 25923™) in diameter, suggesting that all isolates exhibited sensitivity to AR.
Because AR showed the advanced effect of growth inhibition in combination with antibiotics, AR is a naturally formed antimicrobial agent presenting in thermally processed foods with potential health benefits in medical practice.

Swan-Neck Deformity By David R Steinberg, MD, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Reviewed / Revised Apr 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Topic Resources Swan-Neck Deformity A swan-neck deformity consists of hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and sometimes flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.
With simultaneous thumb instability, pinch is greatly impaired.
This deformity can usually be corrected by interphalangeal arthrodesis along with tendon reconstruction at the MCP joint.
Although characteristic in rheumatoid arthritis, swan-neck deformity has several causes, including untreated mallet finger, laxity of the ligaments of the volar aspect of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (eg, as can occur after rheumatic fever or in systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] as Jaccoud arthropathy), spasticity of intrinsic hand muscles, rupture of the flexor tendon of the PIP joint, and malunion of a fracture of the middle or proximal phalanx.
The inability to correct or compensate for hyperextension of the PIP joint makes finger closure impossible and can cause severe disability.
Treatment of swan-neck deformity is aimed at correcting the underlying disorder when possible (eg, correcting the mallet finger or any bony malalignment, releasing spastic intrinsic muscles).
Mild deformities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be treated with a functional ring splint.
Severe disability may require surgical treatment.
True swan-neck deformity does not affect the thumb, which has only one interphalangeal joint.
However, severe hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb with flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint can occur; this is called a duck bill, Z (zigzag) type, or 90 ° - angle deformity.
Evaluation of the Hip By Alexandra Villa-Forte, MD, MPH, Cleveland Clinic Reviewed / Revised Feb 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Physical Examination of the Hip Arthrocentesis of the Hip Topic Resources How to Examine the Hip An evaluation of the hip includes a physical examination and sometimes arthrocentesis.
How to Examine the Hip VIDEO Arthrocentesis of the Hip Arthrocentesis of the hip is usually done using ultrasound guidance by an orthopedic specialist or an interventional radiologist and is not discussed here.
Physical Examination of the Hip Examination begins with gait evaluation.
A limp is common among patients with significant hip arthritis and may be caused by any of the following: Pain Leg shortening Flexion contracture Muscle weakness Knee problems Loss of internal rotation (an early change in hip osteoarthritis or any hip synovitis), flexion, extension, or abduction can usually be demonstrated.
Placement of one hand on the patient's iliac crest detects pelvic movement that might be mistaken for hip movement.
Flexion contracture can be identified by attempting leg extension with the opposite hip maximally flexed to stabilize the pelvis.
Tenderness over the femoral greater trochanter suggests bursitis (which is extra-articular) rather than an intra-articular disorder.
Pain with passive range of motion (assessed by internal and external rotation with the patient supine and the hip and knee flexed to 90°) suggests intra-articular origin.
However, patients may have simultaneous intra-articular and extra-articular disorders.
Intravenous Vitamin Therapy (Myers' Cocktail) By Laura Shane-McWhorter, PharmD, University of Utah College of Pharmacy Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Claims Evidence Adverse Effects Drug Interactions References Intravenous (IV) vitamin therapy (also known as IV micronutrient therapy and hydration therapy) facilitates rapid, high blood levels of vitamins.
In 2018, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged a company marketing and selling the Myers' cocktail and other IV vitamin and mineral infusions of making "deceptive and unsupported health claims" about the ability of these infusions to treat such diseases as cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and heart failure.
The FTC argued that these health treatments and efficacy claims were false or not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence (see FTC Cases and Proceedings).
Adverse Effects In people with abnormalities in blood levels of magnesium or potassium, infusions containing magnesium or, less commonly, potassium, can cause arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
If the infusion is administered too quickly, it can lower blood pressure (probably due to the magnesium), which can lead to light-headedness and fainting.
However, some people may have a gradual increase in blood pressure.
Other adverse effects that have been reported are depression, insomnia, and upset stomach.
The safety of IV vitamin therapy in pregnant and breastfeeding women has not been studied.
Drug Interactions Which drugs interact with IV vitamin treatments depends on which vitamins and minerals are infused and their doses.
Following are a few examples of interactions: IV vitamin B6 can lead to poorer responses to drugs taken to stimulate hematopoiesis (eg, erythropoietin, epoetin alfa, and darbepoetin alfa).
The Myers' cocktail is a popular formula among complementary and alternative medicine providers for IV vitamin therapy (1).
Ceftriaxone could bind together with infused calcium in the blood, and this combination could damage the kidneys, lungs, or gallbladder.
The Myers' formula consists of high doses of B vitamins, vitamin C, minerals (magnesium and calcium), hydroxocobalamin, pyridoxine, and dexpanthenol, mixed with sterile water.
Another multivitamin IV treatment containing thiamine, folic acid, magnesium, and a multivitamin has also been called "banana bags."
It has been used in routine clinical care to treat patients suspected of undernutrition, such as those who chronically ingest large amounts of alcohol.
Claims IV vitamin therapy is supposedly best used for people who cannot get enough vitamins and minerals because they cannot eat enough food or an illness prevents them from absorbing nutrients (2).
Some advocates claim that IV vitamin therapy can enhance wellness even in people who do not have vitamin (or mineral) deficiencies.
Clinics and companies offering the Myers' cocktail and other high-dose IV vitamin formulations claim that these infusions can do the following: Treat dehydration after extreme exercise or too much alcohol intake Boost the immune system Increase levels of energy and reduce fatigue Relieve stress, anxiety, and depression Eliminate toxins from the body Make skin healthier Treat asthma, allergies, chronic sinusitis, high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, diabetes, heart disease, acute muscle spasms, and Parkinson disease Treat migraine and tension headaches Evidence There is insufficient scientific evidence that IV vitamin therapy has any of the above beneficial effects or is effective for treating any disease (3, 4).
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) By Laura Shane-McWhorter, PharmD, University of Utah College of Pharmacy Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Claims Evidence Adverse Effects Drug Interactions References More Information Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid produced by the adrenal gland and is a precursor of estrogens and androgens.
In addition, DHEA is banned by numerous professional sports organizations as it is classified as a "prohormone."
DHEA levels are known to naturally decrease with age and therefore people in search of the unattainable fountain of youth have turned to DHEA supplementation as a possible solution to ailments associated with age.
Studies have been reported showing both positive and negative results.
More thorough studies are warranted not only with aging but with all clinical health conditions.
An analysis of data from 4 randomized controlled trials in women and men aged ≥ 55 years found that daily supplementation of DHEA compared to placebo resulted in significant increases in lumbar spine and trochanter bone mineral density in women but not men, although men had a significant decrease in fat mass (1).
A 2013 meta-analysis of data collected from studying 1353 older men in a number of trials indicated that DHEA supplementation was associated with a reduction of fat mass; however, no effect was observed for numerous other clinical parameters, including lipid and glycemic metabolism, bone health, sexual function, or quality of life (2).
A similar analysis was performed in women with adrenal insufficiency and indicated that DHEA supplementation may improve the quality of life and symptoms of depression, while having no effect on anxiety and sexual well-being (3).
A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials in 853 subjects reported that, compared to placebo, DHEA significantly improved depressive symptoms.
However, the authors stated there was low quality of evidence because included studies had small populations with varying psychiatric diagnoses, and the results were divergent (4).
A 2006 systematic review of 5 studies found little evidence of a beneficial effect of DHEA supplementation on cognitive function of middle‐aged or older people who did not have dementia (5).
Effects on the body are similar to those of testosterone.
The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines on complementary and alternative medicine treatments for depression treatment have stated that DHEA may be considered as third-line treatment for depression (6).
Adverse Effects Adverse effects are unclear.
There are theoretical risks of gynecomastia in men, hirsutism in women, acne, headache, mood changes, and stimulation of prostate, liver, and breast cancers.
It may decrease HDL cholesterol, increase triglycerides, and worsen polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
There are case reports of mania and one of seizure.
DHEA has triggered mania in people taking antidepressants.
DHEA may antagonize the anti-estrogenic effects of tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole), and fulvestrant.
DHEA may increase the concentrations of the benzodiazepine triazolam, and decrease the effectiveness of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination for tuberculosis.
DHEA can also be synthesized from precursors in the wild Mexican yam; this form is the most commonly available.
However, consumption of wild yam is not recommended as a supplement as the body is unable to convert the precursors to DHEA.
Claims DHEA supplements are said to improve mood, energy, sense of well-being, and the ability to function well under stress.
They are also said to improve muscle strength and athletic performance, stimulate the immune system, deepen nightly sleep, lower cholesterol levels, decrease body fat, build muscles, increase bone mineral density, relieve depression, reverse aging, improve the appearance of aging skin, improve brain function in patients with Alzheimer disease, treat infertility in females undergoing assisted reproduction, increase libido, and decrease symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus.
A prescription DHEA ovule or suppository has been used to treat vaginal atrophy.
Evidence The medicinal claims of DHEA have not been fully supported by the evidence.
Stroke Rehabilitation By Salvador E Portugal, DO, New York University, Robert I Grossman School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Aug 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Rehabilitation after stroke aims to preserve or improve range of motion, muscle strength, bowel and bladder function, and functional and cognitive abilities.
Ambulation problems, spasticity, visual field defects (eg, hemianopia), incoordination, and aphasia require specific therapy.
Hemiplegia For patients with hemiplegia, placing 1 or 2 pillows under the affected arm can prevent dislocation of the shoulder.
A posterior foot splint applied with the ankle in a 90° position can prevent equinus deformity (talipes equinus) and footdrop.
Resistive exercise for hemiplegic extremities may increase spasticity and thus is controversial.
However, reeducation and coordination exercises of the affected extremities are added as soon as tolerated, often within 1 week.
Active and active-assistive range-of-motion exercises are started shortly afterward to maintain range of motion.
Active exercise of the unaffected extremities must be encouraged, as long as it does not cause fatigue.
Various activities of daily living (eg, moving in bed, turning, changing position, sitting up) should be practiced.
For hemiplegic patients, the most important muscle for ambulation is the unaffected quadriceps.
Specific programs are based on the patient's social situation (eg, prospects of returning to home or work), ability to participate in a rehabilitation program supervised by nurses and therapists, learning ability, motivation, and coping skills.
A gait abnormality in hemiplegic patients is caused by many factors (eg, muscle weakness, spasticity, distorted body image) and is thus difficult to correct.
Also, attempts to correct gait often increase spasticity, may result in muscle fatigue, and may increase the already high risk of falls, which often result in a hip fracture; functional prognosis of hemiplegic patients with a hip fracture is very poor.
Consequently, as long as hemiplegic patients can walk safely and comfortably, gait correction should not be tried.
Additional treatments for hemiplegia may include the following: Constraint-induced movement therapy: The functional limb is restrained during waking hours, except during specific activities, and patients are forced to do tasks mainly with the affected extremity.
Robotic therapy: Robotic devices are used to provide intensive repetition of the therapeutic movement, guide an affected extremity in executing the movement, provide feedback (eg, on a computer screen) for patients, and measure patient progress.
Partial weight-supported ambulation: A device (eg, treadmill) that bears part of a patient's weight is used during ambulation.
The amount of weight borne and speed of ambulation can be adjusted.
This approach is often used with robotics, which allows patients to contribute to ambulation but provides force as needed for ambulation.
Total body vibration: Patients stand on an exercise machine with a platform that vibrates by rapidly shifting weight from one foot to the other.
A stroke that impairs comprehension often makes rehabilitation very difficult.
The movement stimulates reflexive muscle contraction.
Ambulation problems Before ambulation exercises can be started, patients must be able to stand.
Patients first learn to stand from the sitting position.
The height of the seat may need to be adjusted.
Patients must stand with the hips and knees fully extended, leaning slightly forward and toward the unaffected side.
Using the parallel bars is the safest way to practice standing.
The goal of ambulation exercises is to establish and maintain a safe gait, not to restore a normal gait.
Most hemiplegic patients have a gait abnormality, which is caused by many factors (eg, muscle weakness, spasticity, distorted body image) and is thus difficult to correct.
Also, attempts to correct gait often increase spasticity, may result in muscle fatigue, and may increase the already high risk of falls.
During ambulation exercises, patients place the feet > 15 cm (> 6 in) apart and grasp the parallel bars with the unaffected hand.
Patients take a shorter step with the hemiplegic leg and a longer step with the unaffected leg.
Patients who begin walking without the parallel bars may need physical assistance from and later close supervision by the therapist.
Generally, patients use a cane or walker when first walking without the parallel bars.
The diameter of the cane handle should be large enough to accommodate an arthritic hand.
For stair-climbing, ascent starts with the better leg, and descent starts with the affected leg (good leads up; bad leads down).
If possible, patients ascend and descend with the railing on the unaffected side, so that they can grasp the railing.
Looking up the staircase may cause vertigo and should be avoided.
During descent, patients should use a cane.
The cane should be moved to the lower step shortly before descending with the bad leg.
Patients must learn to prevent falls, which are the most common accident among stroke patients and which often result in hip fracture.
To prevent secondary disabilities (eg, contractures) and help prevent depression, rehabilitation should begin as soon as patients are medically stable.
For hemiplegic patients, who almost always fall on their hemiplegic side, leaning their affected side against a railing (when standing or climbing stairs) can help prevent falls.
Doing strengthening exercises for weak muscles, particularly in the trunk and legs, can also help.
For patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, treatment includes support stockings, drugs, and tilt table training.
Because hemiplegic patients are prone to vertigo, they should change body position slowly and take a moment after standing to establish equilibrium before walking.
Comfortable, supportive shoes with rubber soles and with heels ≤ 2 cm (3/4 in) should be worn.
Spasticity In some stroke patients, spasticity develops.
Spasticity is an increased, involuntary, velocity-dependent muscle tone that causes resistance to movement (1).
Spasticity may be painful and debilitating.
Slightly spastic knee extensors can lock the knee during standing or cause hyperextension (genu recurvatum), which may require a knee brace with an extension stop.
Preventive measures for pressure ulcers must be started even before patients are medically stable.
Flexor spasticity develops in most hemiplegic hands and wrists.
Unless patients with flexor spasticity do range-of-motion exercises several times a day, flexion contracture may develop rapidly, resulting in pain and difficulty maintaining personal hygiene.
Patients and family members are taught to do these exercises, which are strongly encouraged.
A hand or wrist splint may also be useful, particularly at night.
Heat or cold therapy can temporarily decrease spasticity and allow the muscle to be stretched.
Hemiplegic patients may be given benzodiazepines to minimize apprehension and anxiety, particularly during the initial stage of rehabilitation, but not to reduce spasticity.
The effectiveness of long-term benzodiazepine therapy for reducing spasticity is questionable.
Methocarbamol has limited value in relieving spasticity and causes sedation.
Patients can safely begin sitting up once they are fully conscious and neurologic deficits are no longer progressing, usually ≤ 48 hours after the stroke.
Pract Neurol 12 (5): 289 - 298, 2012. doi: 10.1136 / practneurol-2011 - 000155 Hemianopia Patients with hemianopia (defective vision or blindness in half the visual field of one or both eyes) should be made aware of it and taught to move their heads toward the hemiplegic side when scanning.
Family members can help by placing important objects and by approaching the patient on the patient's unaffected side.
Repositioning the bed so that patients can see a person entering the room through the doorway may be useful.
While walking, patients with hemianopia tend to bump into the door frame or obstacles on the hemiplegic side; they may need special training to avoid this problem.
When reading, patients who have difficulty looking to the left may benefit from drawing a red line on the left side of the newspaper column.
When they reach the end of a line of text, they scan to the left of the column until they see the red line, cueing them to begin reading the next line.
Using a rule to keep focused on each line of text may also help.
Occupational therapy After a stroke, fine coordination may be absent, causing patients to become frustrated.
Occupational therapists may need to modify patients' activities and recommend assistive devices (see table Assistive Devices).
Early in the rehabilitation period, when the affected extremities are flaccid, each joint is passively exercised through the normal range of motion 3 to 4 times / day.
Occupational therapists should also evaluate the home for safety and determine the extent of social support.
They can help obtain any necessary devices and equipment (eg, bathtub bench, grab bars by the bathtub or toilet).
Occupational therapists can also recommend modifications that enable patients to do activities of daily living (ADLs) as safely and independently as possible—for example, rearranging the furniture in living areas and removing clutter.
Patients and caregivers are taught how to transfer between surfaces (eg, shower, toilet, bed, chair) and, if necessary, how to modify ways of doing ADLs.
For example, patients may be taught to dress or shave using only one hand and to eliminate unnecessary motion while preparing food or shopping for groceries.
Therapists may suggest using clothing and shoes with touch fasteners (eg, Velcro) or dinner plates with rims and rubber grips (to facilitate handling).
Patients with impairments in cognition and perception are taught ways to compensate.
For example, they can use drug organizers (eg, containers marked for each day of the week).
Regaining the ability to get out of bed and to transfer to a chair or wheelchair safely and independently is important for the patient's psychologic and physical well-being.
Cognitive Errors in Clinical Decision Making By Brian F Mandell, MD, PhD, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University Reviewed / Revised May 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Types of Cognitive Error Risk Factors for Cognitive Error Although quantitative mathematical models can guide clinical decision making, clinicians can only rarely use formal computations to make patient care decisions in day-to-day practice.
Availability error Availability error is when clinicians choose the first thing that comes to their mind.
This often misestimates the actual pretest probability of a disease because a recent or memorable experience makes a given diagnosis more "available" to come to mind.
Experience often leads to overestimation of probability when there is memory of a case that was dramatic, involved a patient who fared poorly, or a lawsuit.
For example, a clinician who recently missed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a healthy young woman who had vague chest discomfort but no other findings or apparent risk factors might then overestimate the risk of pulmonary embolism in similar patients and become more likely to order chest CT angiography for similar patients despite the low probability of disease.
Experience can also lead to underestimation.
For example, a junior resident who has seen only a few patients with chest pain, all of whom turned out to have benign causes, may do a cursory evaluation for cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease even among patient populations in whom the disease prevalence is moderately high.
Representation error Representation error is when clinicians focus on the presence or absence of classic manifestations of a disease without taking into account disease prevalence.
For example, although several hours of vague chest discomfort in a thin, athletic, healthy-appearing 60-year-old man who has no known medical problems and who now looks and feels well does not match the typical profile of a myocardial infarction, it would be unwise to dismiss that possibility because myocardial infarction is common among men of that age and has highly variable manifestations.
Conversely, a 20-year-old healthy man with sudden onset of severe, sharp chest pain and back pain may be suspected of having a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm because those clinical features are common in aortic dissection.
The cognitive error is not taking into account the fact that aortic dissections are exceptionally rare in a 20-year-old, otherwise healthy patient without a family history of such events; that disorder can be dismissed and other, more likely causes (eg, pneumothorax, pleuritis) should be considered.
Rather, an intuitive understanding of probabilities is combined with cognitive processes called heuristics to guide clinical judgment.
Representation error also occurs when clinicians fail to recognize that positive test results (for any test with a less than 100% specificity) in a population where the tested disease is rare are more likely to be false positive than true positive.
Premature closure Premature closure is jumping to conclusions.
This is one of the most common errors; clinicians make a quick diagnosis (often based on pattern recognition), fail to consider other possible diagnoses, and prematurely stop collecting data.
The suspected diagnosis is often not even confirmed by appropriate testing.
Premature closure errors may occur in any case but are particularly common when patients seem to be having an exacerbation of a known disorder—eg, if a woman with a long history of migraine presents with a severe headache (and actually has a new subarachnoid hemorrhage), the headache may be mistakenly assumed to be another attack of migraine.
A variation of premature closure occurs when subsequent clinicians (eg, consultants on a complicated case) unquestioningly accept a previous working diagnosis without independently collecting and reviewing relevant data.
Electronic medical records may exacerbate premature closure errors because incorrect diagnoses may be propagated until they are removed.
Anchoring errors Anchoring errors are when clinicians steadfastly cling to an initial impression even as conflicting and contradictory data accumulate.
For example, a working diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is quite reasonable in a 60-year-old man who has epigastric pain and nausea, who is sitting forward clutching his abdomen, and who has a history of several bouts of alcoholic pancreatitis that he states have felt similar to what he is currently feeling.
However, if the patient states that he has had no alcohol in many years and has normal blood levels of pancreatic enzymes, clinicians who simply dismiss or excuse (eg, the patient is lying, his pancreas is burned out, the laboratory made a mistake) these conflicting data are committing an anchoring error.
Heuristics are often referred to as rules of thumb, educated guesses, or mental shortcuts.
Clinicians should regard conflicting data as evidence of the need to continue to seek the true diagnosis (acute myocardial infarction) rather than as anomalies to be disregarded.
There may be no supporting evidence (ie, for the misdiagnosis) in some cases in which anchoring errors are committed.
Confirmation bias Confirmation bias is "cherry-picking," which means clinicians selectively accept clinical data that support a desired hypothesis and ignore data that do not.
Confirmation bias often compounds an anchoring error when the clinician uses confirmatory data to support the anchored hypothesis even when clearly contradictory evidence is also available.
For example, a clinician may steadfastly cling to patient history elements suggesting acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to confirm the original suspicion of ACS even when serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes are normal.
Attribution errors Attribution errors involve making decisions based on negative stereotypes, which can lead clinicians to ignore or minimize the possibility of serious disease.
For example, clinicians might assume that an unconscious patient with an odor of alcohol is "just another drunk" and miss hypoglycemia, ketosis, or intracranial injury, or they might assume that a known drug abuser with back pain is simply seeking drugs and miss an epidural abscess.
Psychiatric patients who develop a physical disorder are particularly likely to be subject to attribution errors because not only may they be subject to negative stereotyping but they often describe their symptoms in unclear, inconsistent, or confusing ways, leading unwary clinicians to assume their complaints are functional in nature.
Affective error Affective error involves letting personal feelings (positive or negative) about a patient affect decisions.
For example, avoiding unpleasant but necessary tests or examinations because of fondness or sympathy for the patient (eg, avoiding a pelvic examination and STD testing on a patient who is religious or a highly positioned executive or avoiding blood cultures on a seriously ill patient who has poor veins).
Heuristics usually involve pattern recognition and rely on a subconscious integration of somewhat haphazardly gathered patient data with prior experience rather than on a conscious generation of a rigorous differential diagnosis that is formally evaluated using specific data from the literature.
Similarly, affective error includes failing to pursue a standard evaluation on an unlikeable patient (eg, minimizing the significance of dyspnea in a verbally abusive patient or someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who continues to smoke).
Risk Factors for Cognitive Error Internal and external factors can increase the risk of cognitive error.
Internal factors include Medical knowledge, training, and experience Fatigue / sleep deprivation Balance between being risk accepting / risk averse External factors include Workload Distractions Team resource management and peer pressures Minimizing cognitive errors Some specific strategies can help minimize cognitive errors.
Typically, after history and physical examination are done, clinicians often form a working diagnosis based on heuristics.
At this point, it is relatively easy to insert a formal pause for reflection, asking several questions: If it is not the working diagnosis, what else could it be?
What are the most dangerous things it could be?
Is there any evidence that is at odds with the working diagnosis?
These questions can help expand the differential diagnosis to include things that may have been left out because of cognitive errors and thus trigger clinicians to obtain further necessary information.
Such informal reasoning is fallible because heuristics may cause several types of unconscious errors (cognitive errors).
Studies suggest that more medical errors involve cognitive error than lack of knowledge or information.
Types of Cognitive Error There are many types of cognitive (reasoning) errors, and although it is obviously more important to avoid errors than to properly classify them once made, being aware of common types of cognitive errors can help clinicians recognize and avoid them.
Cognitive errors may roughly be classified as those involving Faulty assessment of pre-test probability (overestimating or underestimating disease likelihood) Failure to seriously consider all relevant possibilities Pearls & Pitfalls There are numerous named types of cognitive error, but they tend to fall into 2 groups: faulty assessment of pre-test probability and failure to seriously consider all relevant possibilities.
Both types of error can easily lead to improper testing (too much or too little) and missed diagnoses.
Confidentiality and HIPAA By Charles Sabatino, JD, American Bar Association Reviewed / Revised May 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Traditionally, ethical health care has always included the need to keep patients' medical information confidential.
Access to medical records Typically, patients or their authorized representatives should be able to see and obtain copies of their medical records and request corrections if they identify errors.
For purposes of the Privacy Rule, an authorized "personal representative" of the patient is a guardian with authority over health decisions, a proxy appointed in a power of attorney for health care, or a family member or friend authorized to serve as a surrogate for health decisions under state law.
Notice of privacy practices Health care providers must provide a notice about their possible uses of personal medical information and about patient rights under HIPAA regulations.
Limits on use of personal medical information HIPAA limits how health care providers may use PHI.
The act does not restrict physicians, nurses, and other practitioners from sharing information needed to treat their patients.
Disclosures to health information exchanges and public health agencies for public health purposes during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic are also permissible disclosures under guidelines of the Office for Civil Rights in the US Department of Health and Human Services.
However, practitioners may use or share only the minimum amount of protected information needed for a particular purpose.
In most situations, personal health information may not be used for purposes unrelated to health care.
HIPAA requires that the patient's specific authorization must be obtained before disclosing information for marketing purposes.
Health care providers must disclose any payments that will be received as a result of marketing.
However, health care providers can freely communicate with patients about treatment options, products, and other health-related services, including disease-management programs.
Confidential communications Practitioners should take reasonable steps to ensure that their communications with the patient are confidential and in accord with patient preferences.
For example, physician-patient medical discussions generally should be in private, or a patient might prefer that the physician call their office rather than home.
Nonetheless, unless the patient objects, practitioners can share medical information with a patient's immediate family members or someone known to be a close personal friend if the information relates to that person's involvement with the patient's care or payment for care and the information is limited to what is necessary to that person's involvement.
Practitioners are expected to exercise professional judgment.
An authorized personal representative of the patient should be treated the same as the patient with respect to access to information and participation in decision-making.
Thus, the representative has the same access to information and may exercise the same rights regarding confidentiality of information.
Collectively, these are covered entities under HIPAA.
Nevertheless, practitioners may restrict information or access if there are reasonable concerns about domestic violence, abuse, or neglect by the representative.
Health care practitioners are sometimes required by law to disclose certain information, usually because the condition may present a danger to other people.
For example, certain infectious diseases (eg, COVID-19, HIV, syphilis, TB) must be reported to state or local public health agencies.
Signs of child and, in many states, adult or elder abuse or neglect, typically must be reported to protective services.
Conditions that might seriously impair a patient's ability to drive, such as dementia or recent seizures, must be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles in some states.
Complaints Patients may file complaints about compliance with these privacy practices.
Complaints can be made directly to the health care practitioner, the Office for Civil Rights in the US Department of Health and Human Services, or the privacy compliance officer designated by the institution in compliance with HIPAA.
There are civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure of personal health information.
Key provisions of HIPAA are embodied in three rules (now contained in an omnibus rule): the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification rules, all of which are intended to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, referred to as protected health information (PHI).
The soundest course for health care practitioners is to be well informed about HIPAA, to act in good faith, and make reasonable attempts to comply.
The Privacy Rule sets standards for the protection of PHI and gives patients important rights with respect to their health information.
The Security Rule establishes safeguards that covered entities and their business associates must implement to protect the privacy, integrity, and security of electronic PHI.
The Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities to notify affected individuals, the federal government, and in some cases, the media of a breach of unsecured PHI.
The Office for Civil Rights in the US Department of Health and Human Services enforces these three rules and provides guidance on complying with the rules.
Key aspects of the Privacy Rule are elaborated below.
Alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal By Gerald F O'Malley, DO, Grand Strand Regional Medical Center; Rika O'Malley, MD, Grand Strand Medical Center Reviewed / Revised Dec 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Topic Resources Alcohol Consumption Screening... CIWA-Ar Clinical Institute... Alcohol (ethanol) is a central nervous system depressant.
However, acute alcohol intoxication is a significant factor in injuries, particularly those due to interpersonal violence, suicide, and motor vehicle crashes.
Treatment may include IV thiamin to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy Benzodiazepines or phenobarbital to manage agitation and / or seizures Thiamin 100 mg IV is given to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy.
Alcohol-tolerant people are cross-tolerant to some drugs commonly used to treat withdrawal (eg, benzodiazepines).
Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of therapy.
Dosage and route depend on degree of agitation, vital signs, and mental status.
Diazepam, given 5 to 10 mg IV or orally hourly until sedation occurs, is a common initial intervention; lorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV or orally is an alternative.
Chlordiazepoxide 50 to 100 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours, then tapered, is an older acceptable alternative for less severe cases of withdrawal.
Phenobarbital 10 mg / kg (ideal body weight) IV may be used as an alternative, or in conjunction with benzodiazepines if benzodiazepines alone are ineffective, but respiratory depression is a risk with concomitant use.
Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (when there is no liver disease or pregnancy) may also be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated (1).
Phenothiazines and haloperidol are not recommended initially because they may lower the seizure threshold.
For patients with a significant liver disorder, a short-acting benzodiazepine (lorazepam) or one metabolized by glucuronidation (oxazepam) is preferred.
Chronic alcohol abuse interferes with the ability to socialize and work.
(NOTE: Benzodiazepines may cause intoxication, physical dependence, and withdrawal in patients with alcohol use disorder and therefore should not be continued after the detoxification period.
Carbamazepine 200 mg orally 4 times a day may be used as an alternative and then tapered)
For severe hyperadrenergic activity or to reduce benzodiazepine requirements, short-term therapy (12 to 48 hours) with titrated beta-blockers (eg, metoprolol 25 to 50 mg orally or 5 mg IV every 4 to 6 hours) and clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg IV every 2 to 4 hours can be used, but only as an adjunct and only if absolutely necessary.
A seizure, if brief and isolated, needs no specific therapy; however, some clinicians routinely give a single dose of lorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV as prophylaxis against another seizure.
Repeated or longer-lasting (ie, > 2 to 3 minutes) seizures should be treated and often respond to lorazepam 1 to 3 mg IV.
Routine use of phenytoin is unnecessary and unlikely to be effective.
Outpatient therapy with phenytoin is rarely indicated for patients with simple alcohol withdrawal seizures when no other source of seizure activity has been identified because seizures occur only under the stress of alcohol withdrawal, and patients who are withdrawing or heavily drinking may not take antiseizure drugs.
Delirium tremens may be fatal and thus must be treated promptly with high-dose IV benzodiazepines, preferably in an intensive care unit.
Dosing is higher and more frequent than in mild withdrawal.
Very high doses of benzodiazepines may be required, and there is no maximum dose or specific treatment regimen.
Although estimates vary across studies, about 13.9% of adults meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder (abuse or dependence) in any given year (1).
Diazepam 5 to 10 mg IV or lorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV every 10 minutes is given as needed to control delirium; some patients require several hundred milligrams over the first few hours.
In patients with severe symptoms, evidence suggests dosing regimens of diazepam starting at 10 mg IV with doubling of the dose every 10 to 15 minutes until the patient is sedated is efficacious.
Patients refractory to high-dose benzodiazepines may respond to phenobarbital 120 to 240 mg IV every 20 minutes as needed; however, if phenobarbital is used after benzodiazepines, respiratory depression can be significant.
As an alternative, phenobarbital may be used as the first agent.
Severe drug-resistant DT can be treated with a continuous infusion of lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam, propofol, or dexmedetomidine, usually with concomitant mechanical ventilation.
Physical restraints should be avoided if possible to minimize additional agitation, but patients must not be allowed to escape, remove IVs, or otherwise endanger themselves.
Appreciably elevated temperature with DT is a poor prognostic sign.
Binge drinking, defined as consuming ≥ 5 drinks per occasion for men and ≥ 4 drinks per occasion for women, is a particular problem among younger people.
JAMA Psychiatry 72 (8): 757 - 766, 2015. doi: 10.1001 / jamapsychiatry.2015.0584 Pathophysiology of Alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal One serving of alcohol (one 12-oz can of beer, one 6-oz glass of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled liquor) contains 10 to 15 g of ethanol.
Alcohol is absorbed into the blood mainly from the small bowel, although some is absorbed from the stomach.
The concentration peaks about 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion if the stomach was previously empty.
Large amounts consumed rapidly can cause respiratory depression, coma, and death.
About 5 to 10% of ingested alcohol is excreted unchanged in urine, sweat, and expired air; the remainder is metabolized, mainly by the liver, where alcohol dehydrogenase converts ethanol to acetaldehyde.
Acetaldehyde is ultimately oxidized to CO2 and water at a rate of 5 to 10 mL / hour (of absolute alcohol); each milliliter yields about 7 kcal.
Alcohol dehydrogenase in the gastric mucosa accounts for some metabolism; women have lower gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity than men.
Alcohol exerts its effects by several mechanisms.
Chronic effects Tolerance to alcohol develops rapidly; similar amounts cause less intoxication.
Tolerance is caused by adaptational changes of central nervous system cells (cellular, or pharmacodynamic, tolerance) and by induction of metabolic enzymes.
People who develop tolerance may reach an incredibly high blood alcohol content (BAC).
However, ethanol tolerance is incomplete, and considerable intoxication and impairment occur with a large enough amount.
Large amounts chronically consumed damage the liver and many other organs.
But even people who have developed tolerance may die of respiratory depression secondary to alcohol overdose.
Alcohol-tolerant people are susceptible to alcoholic ketoacidosis, especially during binge drinking.
Alcohol-tolerant people are cross-tolerant to many other central nervous system depressants (eg, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate sedatives, benzodiazepines).
The physical dependence accompanying tolerance is profound, and alcohol withdrawal has potentially fatal adverse effects.
Chronic heavy alcohol intake typically leads to liver disorders (eg, fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis); the amount and duration required vary (see Alcohol-Related Liver Disease).
Patients with a severe liver disorder often have coagulopathy due to decreased hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors, increasing the risk of significant bleeding due to trauma (eg, from falls or vehicle crashes) and of gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, due to gastritis, from esophageal varices due to portal hypertension); alcohol abusers are at particular risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Chronic heavy intake also commonly causes the following: Gastritis Pancreatitis Cardiomyopathy, often accompanied by arrhythmias and hypertension Peripheral neuropathy Brain damage, including Wernicke encephalopathy, Korsakoff psychosis, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, and alcohol-related dementia Certain cancers (eg, liver, head and neck, esophageal), especially when drinking is combined with smoking Indirect long-term effects include undernutrition, particularly vitamin deficiencies.
On the other hand, low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption (≤ 1 to 2 drinks / day) may decrease the risk of death due to cardiovascular disorders (1).
Numerous explanations, including increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and a direct antithrombotic effect, have been suggested.
Alcohol withdrawal manifests as a continuum, ranging from tremor to seizures, hallucinations, and life-threatening autonomic instability in severe withdrawal (delirium tremens).
Special populations Young children who drink alcohol are at significant risk of hypoglycemia because alcohol impairs gluconeogenesis and their smaller stores of glycogen are rapidly depleted.
Women may be more sensitive than men, even on a per-weight basis, because their gastric (first-pass) metabolism of alcohol is less due to lower activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in the gastric mucosa.
Drinking during pregnancy may result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.
Symptoms and Signs of Alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal Acute effects Symptoms progress proportionately to blood alcohol content (BAC).
Actual levels required to cause given symptoms vary with tolerance, but in typical users the following occur: 20 to 50 mg / dL (4.3 to 10.9 mmol / L): Tranquility, mild sedation, and some decrease in fine motor coordination 50 to 100 mg / dL (10.9 to 21.7 mmol / L): Impaired judgment and a further decrease in coordination 100 to 150 mg / dL (21.7 to 32.6 mmol / L): Unsteady gait, nystagmus, slurred speech, loss of behavioral inhibitions, and memory impairment 150 to 300 mg / dL (32.6 to 65.1 mmol / L): Delirium and lethargy (likely) Emesis is common with moderate to severe intoxication; because emesis usually occurs with obtundation, aspiration is a significant risk.
In US states, the legal definition of intoxication is a BAC of ≥ 0.08% (≥ 80 mg / dL, [17.4 mmol / L]); 0.08% is used most commonly.
Toxicity or overdose In alcohol-naïve people, a BAC of 300 to 400 mg / dL (65.1 to 86.8 mmol / L) often causes unconsciousness, and a BAC ≥ 400 mg / dL (86.8 mmol / L) may be fatal.
Diagnosis is clinical or based on diagnosis of typical complications (eg, alcohol-related liver disease).
Sudden death due to respiratory depression or arrhythmias may occur, especially when large quantities are drunk rapidly.
Other common effects include hypotension and hypoglycemia.
The effect of a particular BAC varies widely; some chronic drinkers seem unaffected and appear to function normally with a BAC in the 300 to 400 mg / dL (65.1 to 86.8 mmol / L) range, whereas nondrinkers and social drinkers are impaired at a BAC that is inconsequential in chronic drinkers.
Chronic effects Stigmata of chronic use include vascular spiders, and, in men, signs of hypogonadism and feminization (eg, smooth skin, lack of male-pattern baldness, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy).
Undernutrition may lead to enlarged parotid glands.
Withdrawal A continuum of symptoms and signs of central nervous system (including autonomic) hyperactivity may accompany cessation of alcohol intake.
A mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome includes tremor, weakness, headache, sweating, hyperreflexia, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Tachycardia may be present and blood pressure can be slightly elevated.
Symptoms usually begin within about 6 hours of cessation.
Some patients have generalized tonic-clonic seizures (called alcohol-related seizure, or rum fits) but usually not > 2 in short succession.
(See also Alcohol Use Disorder and Rehabilitation.)
Seizures generally occur 6 to 48 hours after cessation of alcohol.
Alcoholic hallucinosis (hallucinations without other impairment of consciousness) follows abrupt cessation from prolonged, excessive alcohol use, usually within 12 to 24 hours.
Hallucinations are typically visual.
Symptoms may also include auditory illusions and hallucinations that frequently are accusatory and threatening; patients are usually apprehensive and may be terrified by the hallucinations and by vivid, frightening dreams.
Symptoms do not resemble the delirious state of an acute organic brain syndrome as much as does delirium tremens (DT) or other pathologic reactions associated with withdrawal.
Consciousness remains clear, and the signs of autonomic lability that occur in DT are usually absent.
When hallucinosis occurs, it usually precedes DT and is transient.
Delirium tremens usually begins 48 to 72 hours after alcohol withdrawal; anxiety attacks, increasing confusion, poor sleep (with frightening dreams or nocturnal illusions), profuse sweating, and severe depression also occur.
Fleeting hallucinations that arouse restlessness, fear, and even terror are common.
About half of adults in the US currently drink alcohol, 20% are former drinkers, and 30 to 35% are lifetime abstainers.
Typical of the initial delirious, confused, and disoriented state is a return to a habitual activity; eg, patients frequently imagine that they are back at work and attempt to do some related activity.
Autonomic lability, evidenced by diaphoresis and increased pulse rate and temperature, accompanies the delirium and progresses with it.
Mild delirium is usually accompanied by marked diaphoresis, a pulse rate of 100 to 120 beats / minute, and a temperature of 37.2 to 37.8 ° C Marked delirium, with gross disorientation and cognitive disruption, is accompanied by significant restlessness, a pulse of > 120 beats / minute, and a temperature of > 37.8 ° C; risk of death is high.
During delirium tremens, patients are suggestible to many sensory stimuli, particularly to objects seen in dim light.
Vestibular disturbances may cause them to believe that the floor is moving, the walls are falling, or the room is rotating.
As the delirium progresses, resting tremor of the hand develops, sometimes extending to the head and trunk.
Symptoms vary among patients but are usually the same for a particular patient with each recurrence.
Diagnosis of Alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal Usually a clinical diagnosis Acute intoxication: Sometimes blood alcohol content (BAC) and a rapid blood glucose test Chronic use: Complete blood count, magnesium, liver tests, and PT / PTT Withdrawal: Evaluation to rule out central nervous system injury and infection Diagnosis is usually made based on typical signs and symptoms.
In acute alcohol intoxication, laboratory tests are generally not helpful; diagnosis is usually made clinically.
Exceptions include fingerstick glucose to rule out hypoglycemia and sometimes tests to determine BAC.
Confirmation by breath or blood alcohol levels is useful for legal purposes (eg, to document intoxication in drivers or employees who appear impaired).
BAC levels do not always correlate to level of intoxication; for a given BAC level, chronic drinkers may have less impairment compared to a person who does not drink regularly.
However, finding a low BAC in patients who have altered mental status is helpful because it expedites the search for an alternate cause.
Clinicians should not assume that a high BAC in patients with apparently minor trauma accounts for their obtundation, which may be due to intracranial injury or other abnormalities.
Such patients should also have additional evaluation to search for evidence of trauma or toxicity due to other substances.
Chronic alcohol abuse and dependence are clinical diagnoses; experimental markers of long-term use have not proved sufficiently sensitive or specific for general use.
Screening tests such as AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) or the CAGE questionnaire can be used.
However, heavy alcohol users may have a number of metabolic derangements that are worth screening for, so complete blood count, electrolytes (including magnesium), liver tests (including coagulation profile [PT / PTT]), serum ammonia, and serum albumin are often recommended.
In severe withdrawal and toxicity, symptoms may resemble those of central nervous system injury or infection.
For most drinkers, the frequency and amount of alcohol consumption does not impair physical or mental health or the ability to safely carry out daily activities.
Because concomitant medical and surgical conditions can occur simultaneously with alcohol withdrawal, medical evaluation with CT and lumbar puncture may be needed.
Patients with mild symptoms do not require routine testing unless improvement is not marked within 2 to 3 days.
A clinical assessment tool for severity of alcohol withdrawal is available.
Treatment of Alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal Supportive measures For withdrawal, benzodiazepines and sometimes also phenobarbital or propofol Toxicity or overdose Treatment of alcohol toxicity may include the following: Airway protection Sometimes IV fluids with thiamin, magnesium, and vitamins The first priority is ensuring an adequate airway; endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required for apnea or inadequate respirations.
IV hydration is needed for hypotension or evidence of volume depletion but does not significantly enhance ethanol clearance.
When IV fluids are used, a single dose of thiamin 100 mg IV is given to treat or prevent Wernicke encephalopathy.
Many clinicians also add multivitamins and magnesium to the IV fluids.
Pearls & Pitfalls IV hydration does not significantly enhance ethanol clearance.
Disposition of the acutely intoxicated patient depends on clinical response, not a specific BAC.
Withdrawal Patients with severe alcohol withdrawal or delirium tremens should be managed in an intensive care unit until these symptoms abate.

For example, if an emergency procedure is required (eg, for intra-abdominal hemorrhage, perforated viscus, necrotizing fasciitis), there is usually no time for a full preoperative evaluation.
However, the patient's history should be reviewed as expeditiously as possible, particularly for allergies and to help identify factors that increase risk of emergency surgery (eg, history of bleeding problems or adverse anesthetic reactions).
History A relevant preoperative history includes information about all of the following: Current symptoms suggesting an active cardiopulmonary disorder (eg, cough, chest pain, dyspnea during exertion, ankle swelling) or infection (eg, fever, dysuria) Risk factors for excessive bleeding (eg, known bleeding disorder, history of bleeding excessively with dental procedures, elective surgeries, or childbirth) Risk factors for thromboembolism (Professional. see p Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)) Risk factors for infection Risk factors for cardiac disease Known disorders that increase risk of complications, particularly hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, asthma, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Previous surgery, anesthesia, or both, particularly their complications Allergies Tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use Current prescription and nonprescription drug and supplement use History of obstructive sleep apnea or excessive snoring If an indwelling bladder catheter may be needed, patients should be asked about prior urinary retention and prostate surgery.
Physical examination Physical examination should address not only areas affected by the surgical procedure but also the cardiopulmonary system, as well as a search for any signs of ongoing infection (eg, upper respiratory tract, skin).
When spinal anesthesia is likely to be used, patients should be evaluated for scoliosis and other anatomic abnormalities that may complicate lumbar puncture.
Any cognitive dysfunction, especially in older patients who will be given a general anesthetic, should be noted.
Preexisting dysfunction may become more apparent postoperatively and, if undetected beforehand, may be misinterpreted as a surgical complication.
Testing Because healthy patients undergoing elective surgery have a low prevalence of silent disease that would otherwise influence perioperative management, routine preoperative testing should not be done in those without clinical symptoms or significant underlying disease.
Such testing is not cost-effective and results in false-positive tests, unintended patient alarm, and delays in surgery.
Preoperative testing should therefore be individualized and based on the patient's clinical presentation, although preoperative beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) pregnancy testing should be done in all women of childbearing age (1, 2, 3).
The goal of a thorough preoperative evaluation should be to provide patients with a personalized surgical plan to minimize operative risk and postoperative complications.
In symptomatic patients, those with known underlying disease, or those undergoing operations with a higher risk of significant bleeding or other complications, laboratory evaluation may include the following tests: Complete blood count (CBC) and urinalysis (glucose, protein, and cells) usually are done.
CBC is particularly relevant in patients > 65 or in younger patients with significant anticipated blood loss.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine and plasma glucose are measured unless patients are extremely healthy and < 50, the procedure is considered very low risk, and use of nephrotoxic drugs is not expected.
Liver tests are often measured if abnormalities are suspected based on the patient's history or examination.
Coagulation studies and bleeding time are needed only if patients have a personal or family history of bleeding diathesis or a disorder associated with bleeding.
ECG is done for patients at risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), including all men > 45 and women > 50, and for severely obese patients (body mass index ≥ 40 kg / m 2) with at least one risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (eg, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia) or poor exercise tolerance (4).
Chest x-ray only in patients with symptoms of or risk factors for underlying cardiopulmonary disease.
Pulmonary function testing may be done if patients have a known chronic pulmonary disorder or symptoms or signs of pulmonary disease.
Patients with symptomatic CAD need additional tests (eg, stress testing, coronary angiography) before surgery.
In some cases, elective procedures should be delayed when possible so that certain underlying disorders (eg, hypertension, diabetes, hematologic abnormalities) can be optimally controlled.
Circulation 120 (1): 86 - 95, 2009. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192575 Procedural Risk Factors Procedural risk is highest with the following: Heart or lung surgery Hepatic resection Intra-abdominal surgeries that are estimated to require a prolonged operative time or that have a risk of large-volume hemorrhage (eg, Whipple procedure, aortic surgery, retroperitoneal surgery) Open prostatectomy Major orthopedic procedures (eg, hip replacement) Patients undergoing elective surgery that has a significant risk of hemorrhage should consider banking blood for autologous transfusion should it be needed.
Autologous transfusion decreases the risks of infection and transfusion reactions.
In other cases, patients deemed high risk for major surgery may be identified preoperatively as candidates for less invasive interventions.
Emergency surgery has a higher risk of morbidity and mortality than the same surgery done electively.
Patient Risk Factors The contribution of patient risk factors to perioperative morbidity and mortality is best estimated by validated quantitative risk calculators.
For example, the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) has developed a risk calculator to predict perioperative adverse events (see ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator).
Use of these tools not only allows uniformity in interpreting surgeons' outcomes data but also contributes to better shared decision-making and informed consent for patients and family members (1).
Older age is associated with decreased physiologic reserve and greater morbidity if a complication occurs.
However, chronic disorders are more closely associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality than is age alone.
Older age is not an absolute contraindication to surgery.
Cardiac risk factors Cardiac risk factors dramatically increase surgical risk.
Perioperative cardiac risk is typically assessed using the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association's Revised Cardiac Risk Index (see Figure: Algorithm for risk stratification for noncardiac surgery).
It considers the following independent predictors of cardiac risk: History of coronary artery disease (CAD) History of heart failure History of cerebrovascular disease Diabetes requiring treatment with insulin Serum creatinine (2.0 mg / dL) Risk of cardiac complications increases with increasing risk factors: No risk factors: 0.4% (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.8%) 1 risk factor: 1.0% (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.4%) 2 risk factors: 2.4% (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.5%) ≥ 3 risk factors: 5.4% (95% confidence interval 2.8 to 7.9%) A high-risk surgical procedure (eg, vascular surgery, open intrathoracic or intraperitoneal procedure) also independently predicts a high cardiac perioperative risk.
A thorough preoperative medical evaluation may require input from nonsurgical consultants (eg, internists, cardiologists, pulmonologists) to help assess surgical risk.
Patients with active cardiac symptoms (eg, of heart failure or unstable angina) have a particularly high perioperative risk.
Patients with unstable angina have about a 28% risk of perioperative myocardial infarction.
In patients with stable angina, risk is proportional to their degree of exercise tolerance.
Patients with active cardiac symptoms thus require thorough evaluation.
For example, the cause of heart failure should be determined so that perioperative cardiac monitoring and treatment can be optimized before elective surgery.
Other cardiac testing, such as stress echocardiography or even angiography, should be considered if there is evidence of reversible cardiac ischemia on preoperative evaluation.
Preoperative care should aim to control active disorders (eg, heart failure, diabetes) using standard treatments.
Also, measures should be taken to minimize perioperative tachycardia, which can worsen heart failure and increase risk of myocardial infarction; for example, pain control should be optimized and beta-blocker therapy should be considered, especially if patients are already taking beta-blockers.
Coronary revascularization should be considered for patients with unstable angina.
If a heart disorder cannot be corrected before surgery or if a patient is at high risk of cardiac complications, intraoperative and sometimes preoperative monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization may be advised.
Such consultants may also help manage preexisting disease (eg, diabetes) and help prevent and treat perioperative and postoperative complications (eg, cardiac, pulmonary, infectious).
Sometimes the cardiac risk outweighs the benefit of surgery.
In such cases, a less invasive procedure may provide or serve as a bridge to definitive treatment (eg, tube cholecystostomy for cholecystitis) and decrease morbidity and mortality.
Algorithm for risk stratification for noncardiac surgery * Active clinical conditions include unstable coronary syndromes, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, and severe valvular disorders.
† See the ACC / AHA ‡ Clinical risk factors include coronary artery disease, history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and preoperative creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL.
ACC = American College of Cardiology; AHA = American Heart Association; HR = heart rate; MET = metabolic equivalent.
Fleisher LA, Fleischmann KE, Auerbach AD, et al Infections Incidental bacterial infections discovered preoperatively should be treated with antibiotics.
However, infections should not delay surgery unless prosthetic material is being implanted; in such cases, surgery should be postponed until the infection is controlled or eliminated.
Patients with respiratory infections should be treated and have evidence that the infection has resolved before receiving inhalational anesthesia.
Viral infections with or without fever should be resolved before elective surgery is done, especially if a general anesthetic is going to be used.
Psychiatric consultation is occasionally needed to assess capacity or help deal with underlying psychiatric problems that can interfere with recovery.
Fluid and electrolyte imbalances Fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before surgery.
Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia must be corrected before general anesthesia to decrease risk of potentially lethal arrhythmias.
Dehydration and hypovolemia should be treated with IV fluids before general anesthesia to prevent severe hypotension on induction—blood pressure tends to fall when general anesthesia is induced.
Nutritional disorders Undernutrition and obesity increase the risk of postoperative complications in adults.
Nutritional status is assessed preoperatively using history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.
Severe nutritional risk factors include the following: A body mass index < 18.5 kg / m 2 or a history of unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight over 6 months or 5% over 1 month Suggestive physical examination findings (eg, muscle wasting, signs of specific nutritional deficiencies) Low serum albumin levels (< 3 g / dL without evidence of renal or hepatic dysfunction) It is important to ask whether weight loss was intentional, because unintentional weight loss may reflect a catabolic state refractory to nutritional repletion, suggesting serious underlying pathology such as cancer.
Serum albumin is an inexpensive, widely available, and reliable indicator of undernutrition; it should be measured preoperatively in patients who may be undernourished.
Values < 2.8 g / dL predict increased morbidity (including poor wound healing) and mortality.
Because the half-life of serum albumin is 18 to 20 days, levels may not reflect acute undernutrition.
If more acute undernutrition is suspected, a protein with a shorter half-life can be measured; for example transferrin (half-life 7 days) or transthyretin (pre - albumin; half-life 3 to 5 days).
Older patients may benefit from involvement of an interdisciplinary geriatric team, which may need to involve social workers, therapists, ethicists, and other practitioners.
Preoperative and perioperative nutritional support with the aid of a dietitian to prevent and treat specific nutritional and electrolyte deficiencies is most likely to improve outcomes in patients whose histories of weight loss and protein levels indicate severe undernutrition (2).
In some cases, surgery can be delayed so patients can receive nutritional support, sometimes for several weeks (eg, in chronically undernourished patients, to help prevent the refeeding syndrome).
Significant obesity (body mass index > 40 kg / m 2) increases perioperative mortality risk because such patients have increased risk of cardiac and pulmonary disorders (eg, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, coronary artery disease).
Obesity is an independent risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; preoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is indicated in most obese patients.
Obesity also increases risk of postoperative wound complications (eg, fat necrosis, infection, dehiscence, and abdominal wall hernias).
Because not all surgical procedures are elective, the acuity and type of proposed operation should be considered as well as the patient's risk with surgery.
Tubal Dysfunction and Pelvic Abnormalities By Robert W Rebar, MD, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M D.
Hysterosalpingography rarely indicates tubal patency falsely but indicates tubal obstruction falsely in about 15% of cases.
This test can also detect some pelvic and intrauterine abnormalities.
For unexplained reasons, fertility in women appears to be enhanced after hysterosalpingography if the test result is normal.
Thus, if hysterosalpingography results are normal, additional diagnostic tests of tubal function can be delayed for several cycles in young women.
Sonohysterography (injection of isotonic fluid through the cervix into the uterus during ultrasonography) is done to detect or further evaluate intrauterine and tubal abnormalities; it has replaced hysterosalpingography in many specialized infertility centers.
Rarely, laparoscopy is done to further evaluate tubal lesions.
Diagnosis and treatment are often done simultaneously during laparoscopy or hysteroscopy.
Treatment of Tubal Dysfunction and Pelvic Abnormalities Antibiotics if cervicitis or PID is present Laparoscopy and / or hysteroscopy Assisted reproductive techniques Cervicitis or PID, if present, is treated with antibiotics.
Treatment of existing infection is important in general and may improve cervical mucus.
School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Sep 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Diagnosis Treatment Topic Resources Fallopian Tube Obstruction Tubal dysfunction is fallopian tube obstruction or epithelial dysfunction that impairs oocyte, zygote, and / or sperm motility; pelvic structural abnormalities can impede fertilization or implantation.
Antimicrobial therapy does not treat pelvic adhesions caused by current or past pelvic infection.
During laparoscopy, pelvic adhesions can be lysed, or pelvic endometriosis can be fulgurated or ablated by laser.
During hysteroscopy, intrauterine adhesions can be lysed, and submucous fibroids and intrauterine polyps can be removed.
Pregnancy rates after laparoscopic treatment of pelvic abnormalities are low (typically no more than 25%), but hysteroscopic treatment of intrauterine abnormalities is often successful, with a pregnancy rate of about 60 to 70%.
Assisted reproductive techniques are often either a necessity or an alternative particularly in women < 30 years.
Etiology of Tubal Dysfunction and Pelvic Abnormalities Tubal dysfunction can result from Pelvic inflammatory disease Ectopic pregnancy Ruptured appendix Lower abdominal surgery leading to pelvic adhesions Inflammatory disorders (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis) Pelvic structural abnormalities that can impede fertility include Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome) Fibroids obstructing the fallopian tubes or distorting the uterine cavity Intrauterine polyps Certain malformations (eg, bicornuate uterus) Endometriosis can cause tubal, uterine, or other lesions that impair fertility.
Also, cervical factors, including cervicitis or injury (eg, conization procedures for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, obstetric cervical laceration), may contribute to infertility by impairing the production of cervical mucus.
Diagnosis of Tubal Dysfunction and Pelvic Abnormalities Tests for cervical gonorrhea or chlamydia, if cervicitis or PID are suspected Hysterosalpingography or sonohysterography Hysteroscopy to further evaluate abnormalities Rarely laparoscopy If pelvic infection is suspected, tests should be done for gonorrhea or chlamydia.
Also, screening for sexually transmitted infections is typically done as part of routine preconception care.
All infertility evaluations include assessment of the fallopian tubes.
Most often, hysterosalpingography (fluoroscopic imaging of the uterus and fallopian tubes after injection of a radiopaque agent into the uterus) is done 2 to 5 days after cessation of menstrual flow.
Lower-Extremity Edema During Late Pregnancy By Emily E Bunce, MD, Wake Forest School of Medicine; Robert P Heine, MD, Wake Forest School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Dec 2020 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Evaluation Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Some Causes of Edema During... Some Findings That Suggest... Edema is common during late pregnancy.
When extensive, cellulitis, which usually causes focal erythema, may resemble general edema.
Table Evaluation Evaluation of patients with lower-extremity edema during late pregnancy aims to exclude DVT, preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and other pathologic causes of edema.
Physiologic edema is a diagnosis of exclusion.
History History of present illness should include symptom onset and duration, exacerbating and relieving factors (physiologic edema is reduced by lying in the left lateral decubitus position), and risk factors for DVT, preeclampsia, and peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Risk factors for DVT include Venous insufficiency Trauma Hypercoagulability disorder Thrombotic disorders Cigarette smoking Immobility Cancer Obesity Risk factors for preeclampsia include Chronic hypertension Personal or family history of preeclampsia Age < 17 or > 35 First pregnancy Multifetal pregnancy Diabetes Vascular disorders Hydatidiform mole Abnormal maternal serum screening results Obesity Risk factors for peripartum cardiomyopathy include Age > 30 History of cardiomyopathy African descent Multifetal pregnancy History of hypertension and / or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (eg, preeclampsia) Review of symptoms should seek symptoms of possible causes, including the following: Nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice: Preeclampsia Pain, redness, or warmth in an extremity: DVT or cellulitis Dyspnea: Pulmonary edema, peripartum cardiomyopathy, or preeclampsia Sudden increase in weight or edema of the hands and face: Preeclampsia Headache, confusion, mental status changes, blurry vision, or seizures: Preeclampsia Past medical history should include history of DVT, pulmonary embolism, cardiac disease, preeclampsia, and hypertension.
Physical examination Examination begins with review of vital signs, particularly blood pressure.
Areas of edema are evaluated for distribution (ie, whether bilateral and symmetric or unilateral) and presence of redness, warmth, and tenderness.
General examination focuses on systems that may show findings of preeclampsia.
Eye examination includes testing visual fields for deficits, and funduscopic examination should check for papilledema.
Cardiovascular examination includes auscultation of the heart and lungs for evidence of fluid overload (eg, audible S3 or S4 heart sounds, tachypnea, rales, crackles) and inspection of neck veins for jugular venous distention.
The abdomen should be palpated for tenderness, especially in the epigastric or right upper quadrant region.
Neurologic examination should assess mental status for confusion and seek focal neurologic deficits.
Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg Unilateral leg or calf warmth, redness, or tenderness, with or without fever Systemic symptoms or signs of preeclampsia, particularly mental status changes Symptoms or signs of pulmonary edema Interpretation of findings Although edema is common during pregnancy, considering and ruling out the most dangerous causes (preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and DVT) are important: If blood pressure is > 140/90 mm Hg, preeclampsia should be considered.
If edema involves only one leg, particularly when redness, warmth, and tenderness are present, DVT and cellulitis should be considered.
Bilateral leg edema suggests a physiologic process, preeclampsia, or peripartum cardiomyopathy as the cause.
Symptoms or signs of pulmonary edema, particularly in patients who have preeclampsia (or other risk factors), suggest peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Clinical findings help suggest a cause (see table Some Causes of Edema During Late Pregnancy).
Additional findings may suggest preeclampsia (see table Some Findings That Suggest Preeclampsia).
Table Testing If preeclampsia is suspected, urine protein is measured; hypertension plus proteinuria indicates preeclampsia.
Urine dipstick testing is used routinely, but if diagnosis is unclear, urine protein may be measured in a 24-hour collection.
It typically involves the lower extremities but occasionally appears as swelling or puffiness in the face or hands.
Many laboratories can more rapidly assess urine protein by measuring and calculating the urine protein: urine creatinine ratio.
Proteinuria is no longer required to diagnose preeclampsia; abnormal laboratory or clinical findings of preeclampsia in patients with hypertension may also confirm preeclampsia.
If DVT is suspected, lower-extremity duplex ultrasonography is done.
If peripartum cardiomyopathy is suspected, ECG, chest X-ray, and echocardiography are done.
BNP or NT-proBNP is measured.
Treatment Specific causes of edema during pregnancy are treated.
Physiologic edema can be reduced by the following: Intermittently lying on the left side (left lateral decubitus position), which moves the uterus off the inferior vena cava Intermittently elevating the lower extremities Wearing elastic compression stockings Wearing loose clothing that does not restrict blood flow, particularly in the legs Key Points Edema is common and usually benign (physiologic) during late pregnancy.
Physiologic edema is reduced by lying in the left lateral decubitus position, elevating the lower extremities, using compression stockings, and wearing loose clothing that does not restrict blood flow.
Evaluate patients for DVT if they have unilateral leg edema, redness, warmth, and tenderness.
Etiology The most common cause of edema in pregnancy is Physiologic edema Physiologic edema results from hormone-induced sodium retention.
Evaluate patients for peripartum cardiomyopathy if they have dyspnea and if the physical examination detects evidence of fluid overload.
Because preeclampsia significantly increases the risk of peripartum cardiomyopathy, rapidly evaluate patients who have preeclampsia and possible cardiac dysfunction and / or pulmonary edema for peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Edema may also occur when the enlarged uterus intermittently compresses the inferior vena cava during recumbency, obstructing outflow from both femoral veins.
Pathologic causes of edema are less common but often dangerous.
Preeclampsia results from pregnancy-induced hypertension; however, not all women with preeclampsia develop edema.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy can cause other nonspecific symptoms of pregnancy, including dyspnea and fatigue.
Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (Recurrent Abortion; Habitual Abortion) By Antonette T Dulay, MD, Main Line Health System Reviewed / Revised Oct 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Recurrent pregnancy loss is ≥ 2 to 3 spontaneous abortions.
Placental causes include preexisting chronic disorders that are poorly controlled (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], chronic hypertension).
Fetal causes are usually Chromosomal or genetic abnormalities Anatomic malformations Chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus may cause 50% of recurrent pregnancy losses; losses due to chromosomal abnormalities are more common during early pregnancy.
Aneuploidy is involved in up to 80% of all spontaneous abortions occurring at < 10 weeks gestation but in < 15% of those occurring at ≥ 20 weeks.
Diagnosis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Clinical evaluation Tests to identify the cause The diagnosis of recurrent pregnancy loss is clinical, based on history of 2 or 3 prior spontaneous abortions.
Evaluation for recurrent pregnancy loss should include the following to help determine the cause: Genetic evaluation (karyotyping) of both parents and any products of conception as clinically indicated to exclude possible genetic causes Screening for acquired thrombotic disorders: Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM), anti-beta2 glycoprotein I (IgG and IgM), and lupus anticoagulant Thyroid-stimulating hormone Diabetes testing Hysterosalpingography or sonohysterography to check for structural uterine abnormalities Cause cannot be determined in up to 50% of women.
Determining the cause may require extensive evaluation of both parents.
Screening for hereditary thrombotic disorders is not routinely recommended unless supervised by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
Treatment of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Treatment of the cause if possible Some causes of recurrent pregnancy loss can be treated.
If the cause cannot be identified, the chance of a live birth in the next pregnancy is 27 to 75% (1, 2).
Am J Obstet Gynecol 197 (6): 581.e1 - 581.e6, 2007. doi: 10.1016 / j. ajog.2007.09.016 Key Points Recurrent pregnancy loss is ≥ 2 to 3 spontaneous abortions.
Causes of recurrent pregnancy loss may be maternal, paternal, fetal, or placental.
Chromosomal abnormalities (particularly aneuploidy) may cause 50% of recurrent pregnancy losses.
Etiology of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Causes of recurrent pregnancy loss may be maternal, paternal, fetal, or placental.
Common maternal causes include Uterine or cervical abnormalities (eg, polyps, myomas, adhesions, cervical insufficiency) Maternal (or paternal) chromosomal abnormalities (eg, balanced translocations) Poorly controlled chronic disorders (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease) Acquired thrombotic disorders (eg, related to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome with lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin [IgG or IgM], or anti-beta2 glycoprotein I [IgG or IgM]) are associated with ≥ 3 recurrent losses after 10 weeks, after other maternal and genetic causes have been excluded.
Loss of one or more apparently normal pregnancies after 10 weeks can raise suspicion of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (1).
The association with hereditary thrombotic disorders is less clear but does not appear to be strong, except for possibly factor V Leiden mutation.
Paternal causes are less clear, but risk of miscarriage is higher if the father has certain semen analysis abnormalities.
Paternal age > 35 has been studied, but data about increased risk of spontaneous abortion were conflicting.
Overview of High-Risk Pregnancy By Raul Artal-Mittelmark, MD, Saint Louis University School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Sep 2022 View Patient Education Risk Assessment During Pregnancy In a high-risk pregnancy, the mother, fetus, or neonate is at increased risk of morbidity or mortality before, during, or after delivery.
High-risk pregnancies require close monitoring and sometimes referral to a perinatal center, especially if women have complex high-risk conditions.
These centers offer many specialty and subspecialty services, provided by maternal, fetal, and neonatal specialists (1).
When referral is needed, transfer before, rather than after, delivery results in lower neonatal morbidity and mortality rates.
The most common reasons for referral before delivery are Preterm labor (often due to premature rupture of the membranes) Preeclampsia Preexisting or developing disorders (eg, diabetes, hypertension, severe [morbid] obesity) Risk assessment reference 1.
Risk assessment is part of routine prenatal care.
Risk is also assessed during or shortly after labor and at any time that events may modify risk status.
Risk factors are assessed systematically because each risk factor present increases overall risk.
Risk Assessment During Pregnancy Several pregnancy monitoring and risk assessment systems are available.
The most widely used system is the Pregnancy Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), which is a project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments.
PRAMS also enables the CDC and states to monitor changes in health indicators (eg, unintended pregnancy, prenatal care, breastfeeding, smoking, drinking, infant health).
Female Orgasmic Disorder By Allison Conn, MD, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Pavilion for Women; Kelly R Hodges, MD, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Pavilion for Women Reviewed / Revised Mar 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Female orgasmic disorder involves orgasm that is absent, infrequent, markedly diminished in intensity, or markedly delayed in response to stimulation despite normal levels of subjective arousal.
Because the type of stimulation that triggers orgasm varies widely, clinicians must use clinical judgment to determine whether the woman's response is deficient, based on her age, sexual experience, and adequacy of the sexual stimulation she receives.
Treatment of Orgasmic Disorder Self-stimulation Psychologic therapies Data support encouraging self-stimulation (masturbation).
First-line treatment of female orgasmic disorders is directed masturbation, which involves a series of prescribed exercises.
A vibrator placed on the mons pubis close to the clitoris may help, as may increasing the number and intensity of stimuli), simultaneously if necessary.
Education about sexual function (eg, need to stimulate other areas of the body before the clitoris) may help.
Sex therapy for women, with or without their partners, can often help them with concerns about sexual performance and feelings.
Other psychologic therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychotherapy, may help women identify and manage fear of vulnerability and issues of trust with a partner.
Recommending the practice of mindfulness and using mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can help women pay attention to sexual sensations (by staying in the moment) and not judge or monitor these sensations.
Currently, no data suggest that any drug is efficacious in the treatment of female orgasmic disorder.
Key Points Diagnose orgasmic disorder based on DSM-5 clinical criteria.
Female orgasmic disorder can be primary or secondary: Primary: Women have never been able to have an orgasm.
Treat with directed masturbation, usually as first-line therapy.
Recommend sex therapy and other psychologic therapies to help women identify and manage factors that contribute to orgasmic disorder.
Secondary: Women were previously able to have an orgasm but are now no longer able to do so.
Etiology Factors that contribute to female orgasmic disorder include Contextual factors (eg, consistently insufficient foreplay, early ejaculation by the partner, poor communication about sexual preferences) Psychologic factors (eg, anxiety, stress, lack of trust in a partner) Cultural factors (eg, lack of recognition of or attention paid to female sexual pleasure) Drug therapy (eg.
some antipsychotics or, commonly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) Lack of knowledge about sexual function Damage to genital sensory or autonomic nerves or pathways (eg, due to diabetes or multiple sclerosis) Vulval dystrophy (eg, lichen sclerosus) Symptoms and Signs Women with orgasmic disorder often have other types of sexual dysfunction (eg, dyspareunia, pelvic floor dysfunction).
Anxiety disorders and depression are also more common among women with this disorder.
Diagnosis Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) Clinicians interview both partners separately and together if possible; the woman is asked to describe the problem in her own words and should include specific elements (see table Components of the Sexual History for Assessment of Female Sexual Dysfunction).
Diagnosis of orgasmic disorder is clinical, based on criteria in the DSM-5: Delayed, infrequent, or absent orgasm or markedly decreased intensity of orgasm after a normal sexual arousal phase on all or almost all occasions of sexual activity Distress or interpersonal problems due to orgasmic dysfunction No other disorder or substance that exclusively accounts for the orgasmic dysfunction Symptoms must have been present for ≥ 6 months.
Postterm Pregnancy By Julie S Moldenhauer, MD, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Reviewed / Revised Jul 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Treatment Key Points Postterm pregnancy refers to gestation that lasts ≥ 42 (> 41 6/7) weeks.
Risks include Abnormal fetal growth (macrosomia and dysmaturity syndrome) Oligohydramnios Meconium-stained amniotic fluid Nonreassuring fetal test results Fetal and neonatal death Need for neonatal intensive care Dystocia (abnormal or difficult labor) Cesarean delivery Operative vaginal delivery Perineal lacerations Postpartum hemorrhage Postmaturity refers to the condition of the fetus that results when the placenta can no longer maintain a healthy environment for growth and development, usually because the pregnancy has lasted too long.
The fetus may have dry, peeling skin, overgrown nails, a large amount of scalp hair, marked creases on the palms and soles, lack of fat deposition, and skin that is stained green or yellow by meconium.
Meconium aspiration syndrome is a risk.
Antenatal surveillance should be considered at 41 weeks; it involves one of the following: Nonstress testing Modified biophysical profile (nonstress testing and assessment of amniotic fluid volume) A full biophysical profile (assessment of amniotic fluid volume and fetal movement, tone, breathing, and heart rate) Treatment Induction of labor and delivery Sometimes cesarean delivery If there is evidence of fetal compromise or oligohydramnios, delivery is required.
Induction of labor can be considered at 41 to 42 weeks, particularly if the cervix is favorable, and is recommended after 42 weeks.
Key Points Accurate gestational age estimation is essential in making a diagnosis of postterm pregnancy; ultrasonography early in gestation (up to 20 weeks) is the most accurate method.
Consider antenatal surveillance (eg, nonstress testing, biophysical profile) at 41 weeks.
If there is evidence of fetal compromise or oligohydramnios, delivery is required.
Consider inducing labor at 41 to 42 weeks; it is recommended after 42 weeks.
Late-term pregnancy is defined as 41 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks.
Antenatal surveillance should be considered at 41 weeks.
Induction of labor should be considered after 41 weeks and is recommended after 42 weeks.
Accurate gestational age estimation is essential in making a diagnosis of postterm pregnancy.
In women with regular, normal menstrual cycles, gestational age can be estimated based on the first day of the last normal menstrual period.
If dating is uncertain or inconsistent with menstrual dating, ultrasonography early in gestation (up to 20 weeks) is the most accurate with accepted variation of + / − 7 days.
Later in gestation, the variation increases to + / − 14 days at 20 to 30 weeks gestation and + / − 21 days after 30 weeks.
Postterm pregnancy increases risks for the woman and fetus.
Noninvasive Prenatal Screening Strategies By Jeffrey S Dungan, MD, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Oct 2022 View Patient Education 1st-Trimester Screening 2nd-Trimester Screening Sequential 1st - and 2nd-Trimester Screening Topic Resources Ultrasonography Showing Enlarged.. Noninvasive maternal screening, unlike invasive testing, has no risk of test-related complications.
Screening in multiple gestations All forms of screening in singleton pregnancies (described above) are available to patients with a twin pregnancy.
For twin pregnancies, screening performance using traditional methods (triple, quad) has lower sensitivity and specificity than in singleton pregnancies.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening performance appears to be comparable for singleton and twin pregnancies.
Because most dichorionic twin gestations are discordant for chromosome abnormalities, diagnostic testing is required to distinguish which twin is affected.
However, screening for sex chromosome abnormalities in twin pregnancies is usually not available.
No serum screening or cfDNA screening protocols are validated for triplet or higher-order pregnancies.
1st-Trimester Screening Traditionally, 1st-trimester combined screening includes measurement of Maternal serum beta-hCG (total or free) Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) Fetal nuchal translucency (by ultrasonography) Fetal Down syndrome is typically associated with high levels of beta-hCG, low levels of PAPP-A, and enlarged fetal nuchal translucency.
Although enlarged nuchal translucency is associated with increased risk of fetal Down syndrome, no threshold value for nuchal translucency is considered diagnostic.
In large prospective US trials involving women of various ages, overall sensitivity for detection of Down syndrome was about 85%, with a false-positive rate of 5%.
Specialized ultrasound training and adherence to rigorous quality-assurance monitoring of nuchal translucency measurements are necessary to achieve this level of screening accuracy.
By more precisely assessing the risk of fetal abnormalities, noninvasive maternal screening can help women decide whether to have invasive testing.
First-trimester screening should be offered to all pregnant women.
It provides information early so that a definitive diagnosis can be made with CVS.
An important advantage of 1st-trimester screening is that termination of pregnancy is safer during the 1st rather than the 2nd trimester.
Cell-free fetal nucleic acid testing An increasingly used approach, called noninvasive prenatal screening or cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening, can identify fetal chromosomal abnormalities in singleton pregnancies by analyzing circulating cell-free fetal nucleic acids in a maternal blood sample.
This test can be done as early as 10 gestational weeks and is replacing traditional 1st - and 2nd-trimester noninvasive screening in many centers.
Cell-free fetal nucleic acids, most commonly DNA fragments, are shed into the maternal circulation during normal breakdown of placental trophoblast cells.
Variation in amounts of fragments from particular chromosomes predicts fetal chromosomal abnormalities with higher accuracy than traditional 1st - and 2nd-trimester combined screening using serum analytes and ultrasonography.
Also, sex chromosomal abnormalities (X, XXX, XYY, and XXY) can be identified in singleton pregnancies, although with somewhat lower accuracy.
Early validation trials reported > 99% sensitivity and specificity for the identification of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18 in high-risk pregnancies.
Noninvasive maternal screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities should be offered to all pregnant women who have not already decided to have amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening was historically recommended for women with preexisting risk factors for fetal trisomy.
However, in a recent large multicenter trial that studied the effectiveness of cfDNA screening in a low-risk population, sensitivity for detection of fetal Down syndrome was equivalent to that in a high-risk population.
Given the lower incidence of fetal Down syndrome in younger pregnant women, the specificity and positive predictive value were lower than if only high-risk women were screened.
However, cfDNA screening was superior to traditional analyte screening in low-risk women in overall performance.
Cell-free DNA screening has largely replaced serum analyte screening in high-risk women, and in low-risk women it is rapidly surpassing the use of traditional 1st - and 2nd-trimester combined screening with serum analytes and ultrasonography (1).
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering cell-free DNA screening to all pregnant women (2).
Abnormal results from cfDNA screening should be confirmed with diagnostic karyotyping using fetal specimens obtained through invasive techniques.
However, even if CVS is to be done, maternal serum screening should still be offered to check for fetal neural tube defects.
An elevated MSAFP level suggests open spina bifida, anencephaly, or abdominal wall defects.
Unexplained elevations in MSAFP may be associated with increased risk of later pregnancy complications, such as stillbirth or intrauterine growth retardation.
Quadruple screening (aimed mainly at trisomy 21): Maternal levels of beta-hCG, unconjugated estriol, alpha-fetoprotein, and sometimes inhibin A: This screening may be used as an alternative or adjunct to 1st-trimester screening.
Second-trimester multiple marker screening is used to help assess the risk of Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and a few rarer single-gene syndromes (eg, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome).
Maternal serum tests are widely available, but detection rates for Down syndrome are not as high as those obtained with 1st-trimester screening or with cfDNA.
Also, termination of pregnancy is riskier in the 2nd trimester than in the 1st trimester.
Second-trimester screening may also include Targeted ultrasonography Maternal serum screening for neural tube defects An elevated level of MSAFP may indicate a fetal malformation such as open spina bifida.
Results are most accurate when the initial sample is obtained between 16 and 18 weeks gestation, although screening can be done from about 15 to 20 weeks.
Designating a cutoff value to determine whether further testing is warranted involves weighing the risk of missed abnormalities against the risk of complications from unnecessary testing.
Usually, a cutoff value in the 95th to 98th percentile, or 2.0 to 2.5 times the normal pregnancy median (multiples of the median, or MOM), is used.
This value is about 80% sensitive for open spina bifida and 90% sensitive for anencephaly.
Closed spina bifida is usually not detected.
Amniocentesis is eventually required in 1 to 2% of women originally screened.
Lower cutoff values of MSAFP increase sensitivity but decrease specificity, resulting in more amniocenteses.
Women who have been screened for fetal chromosome disorders by cfDNA should have serum screening with MSAFP alone, not with multiple marker screening.
Ultrasonography is the next step if further testing is warranted.
Corrections for maternal weight, diabetes mellitus, race, and other factors may be necessary.
Targeted ultrasonography with or without amniocentesis is done if no explanation can be determined with basic ultrasonography.
Ultrasonography can Confirm gestational age (which may be underestimated) Detect multifetal pregnancy, fetal death, or congenital malformations In some women, ultrasonography cannot identify a cause for elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels.
Some experts believe that if high-resolution ultrasonography done by an experienced operator is normal, further testing is unnecessary.
However, because this test occasionally misses neural tube defects, many experts recommend further testing by amniocentesis regardless of ultrasonography results.
Amniocentesis with measurement of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase levels in amniotic fluid is done if further testing is needed.
Elevated alpha-fetoprotein in amniotic fluid suggests A neural tube defect Another malformation (eg, omphalocele, congenital nephrosis, cystic hygroma, gastroschisis, upper gastrointestinal atresia) Contamination of the sample with fetal blood Presence of acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid suggests A neural tube defect Another malformation Elevated alpha-fetoprotein plus presence of acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid is virtually 100% sensitive for anencephaly and 90 to 95% sensitive for open spina bifida.
Abnormal amniotic fluid markers indicate that a malformation is likely even if high-resolution ultrasonography (which can detect most of these malformations) does not detect a malformation, and parents should be informed.
Maternal serum screening for chromosomal abnormalities During the 2nd trimester, the most common approach to screening is with cfDNA or multiple serum markers.
These markers, adjusted for gestational age, are used mainly to refine estimates of Down syndrome risk beyond that associated with maternal age.
With triple screening (ie, alpha-fetoprotein, hCG, and unconjugated estriol), sensitivity for Down syndrome is about 65 to 70%, with a false-positive rate of about 5%.
Screening can be done during the 1st trimester 2nd trimester Both trimesters (called sequential or integrated screening) Any of the three approaches is acceptable.
Quad screening is triple screening plus measurement of inhibin A Quad screening increases sensitivity to about 80%, with a 5% false-positive rate.
If maternal serum screening suggests Down syndrome, ultrasonography is done to confirm gestational age, and risk is recalculated if the presumed gestational age is incorrect.
If the original sample was drawn too early, another one must be drawn at the appropriate time.
Amniocentesis is offered particularly if risk exceeds a specific prespecified threshold (usually 1 in 270, which is about the same as risk when maternal age is > 35).
Triple screening can also assess risk of trisomy 18, indicated by low levels of all 3 serum markers.
Sensitivity for trisomy 18 is 60 to 70%; the false-positive rate is about 0.5%.
Combining ultrasonography and serum screening increases sensitivity to about 80%.
Analysis of cfDNA does not depend on gestational age and thus is not prone to dating errors.
Targeted ultrasonography Targeted ultrasonography is offered at some perinatal centers and is used to assess risk of chromosomal abnormalities by searching for structural features associated with fetal aneuploidy (so-called soft markers).
However, no structural finding is diagnostic for a given chromosomal abnormality, and all soft markers may also be seen in fetuses that are chromosomally normal.
Maternal levels of alpha-fetoprotein should be measured during the 2nd trimester to check for neural tube defects.
If results from prior trisomy screening were negative (risk-reducing), many of these soft markers have no clinical relevance and may be ignored (1).
Nonetheless, the discovery of such a marker may lead to offering the woman amniocentesis to confirm or exclude a chromosomal abnormality.
If a major structural malformation is present, a fetal chromosomal abnormality is more likely.
Disadvantages include unnecessary anxiety if a soft marker is detected and unnecessary amniocentesis.
Several experienced centers report high sensitivity, but whether a normal ultrasound indicates a substantially reduced risk of fetal chromosomal abnormalities is unclear.
Sequential screening followed by amniocentesis for high-risk patterns increases sensitivity for Down syndrome to 95%, with a false-positive rate of only 5%.
Pearls & Pitfalls Measure maternal levels of alpha-fetoprotein during the 2nd trimester to check for neural tube defects regardless of other tests planned and the timing of those tests.
A variation of sequential screening, called contingent sequential screening, is based on the level of risk indicated by 1st-trimester screening: High risk: Invasive testing is offered without doing 2nd-trimester screening.
Intermediate risk: 2nd-trimester screening is offered.
Low risk (eg, < 1 in 1500): 2nd-trimester screening for Down syndrome is not offered because the 1st-trimester risk is so low.
Patients with abnormal 1st-trimester, 2nd-trimester, or sequential screening should be offered diagnostic testing (eg, amniocentesis).
However, some patients may choose to pursue further testing for fetal trisomy with cfDNA (cell free DNA) analysis (1).
Results of cfDNA testing may indicate low risk and be reassuring but are not definitive.
Benign Ovarian Masses By Kilpatrick, MD, MEd, Baylor College of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Feb 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Benign ovarian masses include functional cysts (eg, corpus luteum cysts) and neoplasms (eg, benign teratomas).
They may hemorrhage into the cyst cavity, distending the ovarian capsule or rupturing into the peritoneum.
Most functional cysts are < 1.5 cm in diameter; few exceed 5 cm.
Functional cysts usually resolve spontaneously over days to weeks.
Polycystic ovary syndrome is usually defined as a clinical syndrome, not by the presence of ovarian cysts.
But ovaries typically contain many 2 - to 6-mm follicular cysts and sometimes contain larger cysts that contain atretic cells.
Benign ovarian tumors Benign ovarian tumors usually grow slowly and rarely become malignant.
They include the following: Benign (mature) teratomas: These tumors are germ cell tumors; they are also called dermoid cysts because although derived from all 3 germ cell layers, they consist mainly of ectodermal tissue.
Fibromas: These slow-growing connective tissue tumors are usually < 7 cm in diameter.
Symptoms and Signs of Benign Ovarian Masses Most functional cysts and benign tumors are asymptomatic, but some cause intermittent dull or sharp pelvic pain or, infrequently, deep dyspareunia.
Most are asymptomatic; some cause pelvic pain.
Hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts may cause pain or signs of peritonitis, particularly when they rupture.
Occasionally, severe abdominal pain results from adnexal torsion of a cyst or mass, usually > 4 cm.
Rarely, ascites and pleural effusion accompany ovarian fibromas; this triad of findings is called Meigs syndrome.
Diagnosis of Benign Ovarian Masses Transvaginal ultrasonography Sometimes tests for tumor markers Masses are usually detected incidentally during pelvic examination or imaging but may be suggested by symptoms and signs.
A pregnancy test is done to exclude ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion in a patient with pelvic pain or abnormal uterine bleeding.
Transvaginal ultrasonography is usually the first-line test to confirm the diagnosis.
Masses that have radiographic characteristics of cancer (eg, mixed cystic and solid components, surface excrescences, multilocular appearance, thick septations, irregular shape) or that are accompanied by ascites require consultation with a specialist and excision.
Tests for tumor markers are done if ovarian cancer is suspected.
CA 125 is usually measured in postmenopausal women with an ovarian mass, but its use in premenopausal women requires clinical judgment.
This and other tumor markers are not reliable for diagnosis because they lack adequate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
Evaluation includes pelvic examination, transvaginal ultrasonography, and sometimes measurement of tumor markers.
For example, tumor marker values may be falsely elevated in women who have endometriosis, uterine fibroids, peritonitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or various cancers.
Tumor markers are best used for monitoring response to treatment in patients with known ovarian cancer Treatment of Benign Ovarian Masses Monitoring with serial transvaginal ultrasonography for selected cysts Sometimes surgery (cystectomy or oophorectomy) Many functional cysts < 5 cm resolve without treatment; serial ultrasonography is done to document resolution.
If asymptomatic women of reproductive age have simple, thin-walled cystic adnexal masses 5 to 8 cm (usually follicular) without imaging characteristics of cancer, expectant management with repeated ultrasonography (eg, every 6 to 8 weeks) is appropriate.
Benign tumors require treatment.
Masses with radiographic characteristics of cancer require exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy and excision.
If technically feasible, surgeons aim to preserve the ovaries (eg, by cystectomy).
Oophorectomy is done for the following: Fibromas that cannot be removed by cystectomy Cystadenomas Cystic teratomas > 10 cm Other types of cysts that cannot be surgically removed separately from the ovary In postmenopausal women, most cysts or masses, particularly if they are > 5 cm Key Points Ovarian cysts and benign ovarian tumors are common gynecologic issues.
Functional cysts, which develop as part of the menstrual cycle, tend to be small (usually < 1.5 cm in diameter), to occur in premenopausal woman, and to resolve spontaneously.
Functional cysts and benign tumors are usually asymptomatic, but sometimes they cause dull or sharp pelvic pain.
Excise masses that have radiographic characteristics of cancer (eg, cystic and solid components, surface excrescences, multilocular appearance, irregular shape) or that are accompanied by ascites.
Treatment varies depending on the type of mass; surgery with cystectomy or oophorectomy is done if the mass is symptomatic or cancer is suspected.
Excise certain cysts and benign tumors, including cysts that do not spontaneously resolve.
Ovarian cysts or other ovarian masses are a common gynecologic issue.
Functional cysts, which develop as part of the menstrual cycle, are common and usually resolve without treatment.
Masses that are symptomatic or do not resolve may need to be removed surgically to be treated and checked for ovarian cancer.
Functional ovarian cysts There are 2 types of functional cysts: Follicular cysts: These cysts develop from graafian follicles (fluid-filled sacs that contain ova and are located in the ovaries).
Corpus luteum cysts: These cysts develop from the corpus luteum (which forms from the dominant follicle after ovulation).
Avoidant / Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) By Evelyn Attia, MD, Columbia University Medical Center; B Timothy Walsh, MD, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Reviewed / Revised Jul 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterized by restriction of food intake; it does not include having a distorted body image or being preoccupied with body image (in contrast to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa).
Diagnosis of ARFID Clinical criteria Criteria for avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder (1) include the following: The food restriction leads to significant weight loss, failure to grow as expected in children, significant nutritional deficiency, dependence on nutritional support, and / or marked disturbance of psychosocial functioning The food restriction is not caused by unavailability of food, a cultural practice (eg, religious fasting), physical illness, medical treatment (eg, radiation therapy, chemotherapy), or another eating disorder—particularly anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa There is no evidence of a disturbed perception of body weight or shape.
However, patients who have a physical disorder that causes decreased food intake but who maintain the decreased intake for much longer than typically expected and to a degree requiring specific intervention may be considered to have avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder.
Treatment of ARFID Cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy is commonly used to help patients normalize their eating.
Key Points Avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder can cause significant weight loss and life-threatening nutritional deficiencies and markedly impair social functioning (eg, participating in family meals).
Diagnose based on specific criteria, particularly distinguishing avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.
Avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder typically begins during childhood but may develop at any age.
The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but it may have genetic and psychosocial components, including trauma, anxiety, autism, and developmental disabilities.
ARFID may initially resemble the picky eating that is common during childhood—when children refuse to eat certain foods or foods of a certain color, consistency, or odor.
However, such food fussiness, unlike avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder, usually involves only a few food items, and the child's appetite, overall food intake, and growth and development are normal.
Patients with avoidant / restrictive food intake may not eat because they lose interest in eating or because they fear that eating will lead to harmful consequences such as choking or vomiting.
They may avoid certain foods because of their sensory characteristics (eg, color, consistency, odor).
Symptoms and Signs of ARFID Patients with avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder avoid eating food and restrict their food intake to such an extent that they have ≥ 1 of the following: Significant weight loss or, in children, failure to grow as expected Significant nutritional deficiency Dependence on enteral feeding (eg, via a feeding tube) or oral nutritional supplements Markedly disturbed psychosocial functioning Nutritional deficiencies can be life threatening, and social functioning (eg, participating in family meals, spending time with friends in situations where eating may occur) can be markedly impaired.
Overview of Trauma - and Stressor-Related Disorders By John W Barnhill, MD, New York-Presbyterian Hospital Reviewed / Revised Apr 2020 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Trauma - and stressor-related disorders involve exposure to a traumatic or stressful event.
Acute stress disorder and PTSD are similar except that acute stress disorder typically begins immediately after the trauma and lasts from 3 days to 1 month, whereas PTSD lasts for > 1 month, either as a continuation of acute stress disorder or as a separate occurrence that begins up to 6 months after the trauma.
Previously, trauma - and stressor-related disorders were considered anxiety disorders.
However, they are now considered distinct because many patients do not have anxiety but instead have symptoms of anhedonia or dysphoria, anger, aggression, or dissociation.
For people with personality disorders (unlike many others who seek counseling), the distress caused by the consequences of their socially maladaptive behaviors is usually the reason they seek treatment, rather than any discomfort with their own thoughts and feelings.
Thus, clinicians must initially help patients see that their personality traits are the root of the problem.
Personality disorders usually start to become evident during late adolescence or early adulthood, although sometimes signs are apparent earlier (during childhood).
Traits and symptoms vary considerably in how long they persist; many resolve with time.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) lists 10 types of personality disorders, although most patients who meet criteria for one type also meet criteria for one or more others.
Some types (eg, antisocial, borderline) tend to lessen or resolve as people age; others (eg, obsessive-compulsive, schizotypal) are less likely to do so.
About 10% of the general population and up to half of psychiatric patients in hospital units and clinics have a personality disorder.
Overall, there are no clear distinctions in terms of sex, socioeconomic class, and race.
However, in antisocial personality disorder, men outnumber women 6: 1.
In borderline personality disorder, women outnumber men 3: 1 (but only in clinical settings, not in the general population).
For most personality disorders, levels of heritability are about 50%, which is similar to or higher than that of many other major psychiatric disorders.
This degree of heritability argues against the common assumption that personality disorders are character flaws primarily shaped by an adverse environment.
The direct health care costs and indirect costs of lost productivity associated with personality disorders, particularly borderline and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, are significantly greater than similar costs associated with major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.
Types of Personality Disorders DSM-5 groups the 10 types of personality disorders into 3 clusters (A, B, and C), based on similar characteristics.
However, the clinical usefulness of these clusters has not been established.
Cluster A is characterized by appearing odd or eccentric.
It includes the following personality disorders with their distinguishing features: Paranoid: Mistrust and suspicion Schizoid: Disinterest in others Schizotypal: Eccentric ideas and behavior Overview of Cluster A Personality Disorders VIDEO Cluster B is characterized by appearing dramatic, emotional, or erratic.
It includes the following personality disorders with their distinguishing features: Antisocial: Social irresponsibility, disregard for others, deceitfulness, and manipulation of others for personal gain Borderline: Inner emptiness, unstable relationships, and emotional dysregulation Histrionic: Attention seeking and excessive emotionality Narcissistic: Self-grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy Overview of Cluster B Personality Disorders VIDEO Cluster C is characterized by appearing anxious or fearful.
It includes the following personality disorders with their distinguishing features: Avoidant: Avoidance of interpersonal contact due to rejection sensitivity Dependent: Submissiveness and a need to be taken care of Obsessive-compulsive: Perfectionism, rigidity, and obstinacy Overview of Cluster C Personality Disorders VIDEO Symptoms and Signs of Personality Disorders According to DSM-5, personality disorders are primarily problems with Self-identity Interpersonal functioning Self-identity problems may manifest as an unstable self-image (eg, people fluctuate between seeing themselves as kind or cruel) or as inconsistencies in values, goals, and appearance (eg, people are deeply religious while in church but profane and disrespectful elsewhere).
Interpersonal functioning problems typically manifest as failing to develop or sustain close relationships and / or being insensitive to others (eg, unable to empathize).
Personality disorders vary significantly in their manifestations, but all are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
People with personality disorders often seem inconsistent, confusing, and frustrating to people around them (including clinicians).
These people may have difficulty knowing the boundaries between themselves and others.
Their self-esteem may be inappropriately high or low.
They may have inconsistent, detached, overemotional, abusive, or irresponsible styles of parenting, which can lead to physical and mental problems in their spouse and / or children.
People with personality disorders may not recognize that they have problems.
Diagnosis of Personality Disorders Clinical criteria (DSM-5) Personality disorders are underdiagnosed.
When people with personality disorders seek treatment, their chief complaints are often of depression or anxiety rather than of the manifestations of their personality disorder.
Once clinicians suspect a personality disorder, they evaluate cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and behavioral tendencies using specific diagnostic criteria.
More sophisticated and empirically rigorous diagnostic tools are available for more specialized and academic clinicians.
Diagnosis of a personality disorder requires the following: A persistent, inflexible, pervasive pattern of maladaptive traits involving ≥ 2 of the following: cognition (ways or perceiving and interpreting self, others, and events), affectivity, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control Significant distress or impaired functioning resulting from the maladaptive pattern Relative stability and early onset (traced back to at least adolescence or early adulthood) of the pattern Also, other possible causes of the symptoms (eg, other mental health disorders, substance use, head trauma) must be excluded.
Many gradually become less severe with age, but certain traits may persist to some degree after the acute symptoms that prompted the diagnosis of a disorder abate.
For a personality disorder to be diagnosed in patients < 18 years, the pattern must have been present for ≥ 1 year, except for antisocial personality disorders, which cannot be diagnosed in patients < 18 years.
Because many patients with a personality disorder lack insight into their condition, clinicians may need to obtain history from clinicians who have treated these patients previously, other practitioners, family members, friends, or others who have contact with them.
Treatment of Personality Disorders Psychotherapy The gold standard of treatment for personality disorders is psychotherapy.
Both individual and group psychotherapy are effective for many of these disorders if the patient is seeking treatment and is motivated to change.
Typically, personality disorders are not very responsive to drugs, although some drugs can effectively target specific symptoms (eg, depression, anxiety).
Disorders that often coexist with personality disorders (eg, depressive disorders, anxiety, substance-related disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and eating disorders) can make treatment challenging, lengthening time to remission, increasing risk of relapse, and decreasing response to otherwise effective treatment.
For treatment recommendations for each disorder, see table Treatment of Personality Disorders.
Table General principles of treatment In general, treatment of personality disorders aims to Reduce subjective distress Enable patients to understand that their problems are internal to themselves Decrease significantly maladaptive and socially undesirable behaviors Modify problematic personality traits Reducing subjective distress (eg, anxiety, depression) is the first goal.
These symptoms often respond to increased psychosocial support, which often includes moving the patient out of highly stressful situations or relationships.
Drug therapy may also help relieve stress.
Reduced stress makes treating the underlying personality disorder easier.
An effort to enable patients to see that their problems are internal should be made early.
Patients need to understand that their problems with work or relationships are caused by their problematic ways of relating to the world (eg, to tasks, to authority, or in intimate relationships).
Achieving such understanding requires a substantial amount of time, patience, and commitment on the part of a clinician.
Clinicians also need a basic understanding of the patient's areas of emotional sensitivity and usual ways of coping.
Family members and friends can help identify problems of which patients and clinicians would otherwise be unaware.
Maladaptive and undesirable behaviors (eg, recklessness, social isolation, lack of assertiveness, temper outbursts) should be dealt with quickly to minimize ongoing damage to jobs and relationships.
Behavioral change is most important for patients with the following personality disorders: Borderline Antisocial Avoidant Behavior can typically be improved within months by group therapy and behavior modification; limits on behavior must often be established and enforced.
Sometimes patients are treated in a day hospital or residential setting.
Treatment is with psychosocial therapies and sometimes drug therapy.
Because family members and friends can act in ways that either reinforce or diminish the patient's problematic behavior or thoughts, their involvement is helpful; with coaching, they can be allies in treatment.
Modifying problematic personality traits (eg, dependency, distrust, arrogance, manipulativeness) takes a long time—typically > 1 year.
The cornerstone for effecting such change is Individual psychotherapy During therapy, clinicians try to identify interpersonal problems as they occur in the patient's life.
Clinicians then help patients understand how these problems are related to their personality traits and provide skills training to develop new, better ways of interacting.
Typically, clinicians must repeatedly point out the undesirable behaviors and their consequences before patients become aware of them.
This strategy can help patients change their maladaptive behaviors and mistaken beliefs.
Although clinicians should act with sensitivity, they should be aware that kindness and sensible advice by themselves do not change personality disorders.
Key Points Personality disorders involve rigid, maladaptive personality traits that are marked enough to cause significant distress or to impair work and / or interpersonal functioning.
Treatments become effective only after patients see that their problems are within themselves, not just externally caused.
Psychosocial therapies are the main treatment.
Personality traits represent patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that are relatively stable over time.
Drugs help control specific symptoms only in selected cases—eg, to control significant anxiety, angry outbursts, and depression.
Personality disorders are often resistant to change, but many gradually become less severe over time.
Skodol AE, Bender DS, Oldham JM: Personality pathology and personality disorders.
In American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry, 7th Edition, edited by LW Roberts, Washington, DC, 2019, pp.
Personality disorders exist when these traits become so pronounced, rigid, and maladaptive that they impair work and / or interpersonal functioning.
These social maladaptations can cause significant distress in people with personality disorders and in those around them.
Drug-Induced Autoimmunity By Jennifer M Barker, MD, Children's Hospital Colorado, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Patients receiving drugs in the novel class of cancer therapeutics called immune checkpoint inhibitors, have an increased risk for development of autoimmune disorders, including endocrine disorders.
Hypophysitis, autoimmune thyroid disease (both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism), type 1 diabetes, and primary adrenal insufficiency have been reported (1, 2).
Treatment is replacement of hormones documented to be deficient.
These might include thyroid hormone, insulin, or glucocorticoids.
(It is 3 to 4 times faster than using sutures.)
If wounds have significant underlying tension, place deep, absorbable sutures before stapling to decrease tension.
Begin at one end of the laceration.
Indications Relatively straight, sharp-edged lacerations of the trunk or an extremity, and superficial lacerations of the scalp Contraindications Absolute contraindications Anticipated MRI, because the magnetic field can tear staples from the skin Relative contraindications Lacerations on the face or neck because the cosmetic result is often inferior to that with suturing Lacerations on hands or feet because pain is more often increased Anticipated head CT because tissue staples create scan artifact Wound closure of any type may be contraindicated for wounds that are contaminated, relatively old, or that would be at higher risk of infection if closed, such as small bites to hands or feet, puncture wounds, or high-velocity missile wounds.
Evert the edges of the wound using forceps, preferably done by a second operator.
Sometimes, the skin can be everted simply by pinching it between the your thumb and forefinger.
Once the edges are in eversion, gently place the staples across the wound.
To ensure the best closure, place the center of the staple device perpendicular to and over the center of the wound.
Once the stapler handle is squeezed, the staple is automatically placed into the wound and bent to the proper configuration.
When placed properly, the crossbar of the staple is elevated a few millimeters above the surface of the skin.
Work from one end of the laceration to the other, placing each staple about 0.5 to 1 cm from its predecessor, as needed to achieve proper apposition of the edges along the entire length of the wound.
Aftercare Apply antibiotic ointment if desired, then leave uncovered or cover with a sterile bandage.
Have the patient remove the dressing and gently cleanse the wound in 24 to 48 hours.
Scalp lacerations can be cleansed by showering within a few hours.
Remove staples using the same time interval as sutures.
(See How To Repair a Laceration With Simple Interrupted Sutures: Aftercare.)
To remove staples, use a dedicated instrument made specifically by the manufacturer of that stapling device.
Place the lower jaw of the staple remover under the crossbar and squeeze the handle.
Warnings and Common Errors Improper wound edge apposition (causing wound edges to overlap) and failure to evert the wound edges are the most common errors.
Align the middle of the staple with the center of the wound.
Pressing too hard on the device when stapling can place the staples too tightly, causing wound ischemia.
Removal of staples can be more uncomfortable than removal of sutures.
Staples can cause significant scarring if left in place too long.
Tips and Tricks Rather than starting at one end of the laceration, many practitioners find it easier to start in the middle and then place subsequent staples in the middle of each open section, until there are no remaining gaps in the wound.
Complications Improper wound edge apposition leading to poor wound closure and cosmetic result In patients who scar easily, a larger scar Worse cosmetic effect, particularly if staples are left in too long Infection Equipment Wound hygiene and closure techniques need not be sterile procedures.
If forceps are not available, the skin can be everted by pinching the skin (eg, with thumb and forefinger).
Clean procedure, barrier protection Face mask and safety glasses (or a face shield), head caps, gowns, gloves Sterile drapes, towels (for wound debridement and suturing) Antiseptic cleaner such as chlorhexidine Syringes, needles, and local anesthesia Tissue forceps Stapling device (including removal device) Antibiotic ointment Nonocclusive dressing Additional Considerations Suturing and stapling have comparable healing outcomes, wound tensile strength, complication rates, patient tolerance, efficiency of closure, scar width, color, general appearance, suture or staple marks, infection rates, cost, and patient acceptance.
In animal studies, staples had less wound inflammation and greater resistance to infection in contaminated wounds.
The major advantage to using staples is faster time to close the wound.
How To Apply a Volar Arm Splint By Miranda Lewis, MD, University of Washington Reviewed / Revised Jul 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Indications Contraindications Complications Equipment Additional Considerations Positioning Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Aftercare Warnings and Common Errors Tips and Tricks Topic Resources Volar splint How To Apply a Volar Arm... A volar splint is device applied to immobilize the wrist and hand.
Lay out a length of splint material matching the distance from just proximal to the MCP joints to the mid-forearm volar surface of the forearm—it should be just shorter than the area covered by the padding.
Apply the splint material from the MCP joints to the mid-forearm along the volar surface.
Indications Isolated distal radius fracture Carpal bone fractures that do not require a thumb spica splint (triquetrum, hamate, pisiform, trapezoid) Severe wrist sprains Immobilization for soft tissue injuries of the hand or wrist (eg, cellulitis) Contraindications None Complications Thermal injury (caused by the exothermic reaction between plaster or fiberglass and water) Excessive pressure causing skin sores and / or ischemic injury Excessive tightness of circumferential wrapping may contribute to compartment syndrome Equipment Stockinette (enough to cover the area from metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joints to the mid-forearm) Roll padding (eg, cotton roll) 7.5-cm (3-inch) width Plaster or fiberglass splinting material, 7.5 - to 10-cm (3 - to 4-inch) width—wide enough to cover from the MCP joints and extend along the volar surface of the hand and forearm to the mid-forearm Strong scissors and / or shears Elastic bandage, usually 7.5 - to 10-cm (3 - to 4-inch) width Lukewarm water and bucket or other container Nonsterile gloves Additional Considerations The volar splint does not prevent pronation or supination.
Maintain the wrist at 10 to 20° extension until the splinting material hardens.
How To Apply a Volar Arm Splint VIDEO Aftercare Advise the patient to keep the splint dry.
If these motions should be immobilized, a sugar tong splint should be used.
Volar splint Positioning The patient should be positioned so that the operator has appropriate access to the patient's affected hand.
Splint the wrist at 10 to 20° extension.
Apply stockinette, covering the area from distal to the MCP joints to the mid-forearm.
Wrap the padding from the MCP joint to the mid-forearm slightly beyond the area to be covered by the splint material; overlap each turn by half the width of the padding and periodically tear the wrapping across its width to decrease the risk of tissue compression.
Pulmonary Barotrauma By Richard E Moon, MD, Duke University Medical Center Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Key Points More Information Barotrauma is tissue injury caused by a pressure-related change in body compartment gas volume.
The most common form of pulmonary barotrauma is pneumomediastinum.
Mediastinal air can track into the neck, causing subcutaneous emphysema detectable as crepitation, and voice changes.
A crackling sound rarely heard over the heart ("mediastinal crunch," Hamman sign).
Air can sometimes track caudad into the peritoneal cavity (falsely suggesting a ruptured viscus and the need for laparotomy), but it does not typically cause peritoneal signs.
Tension pneumothorax, although rare with barotrauma, can cause hypotension, distended neck veins, hyperresonance to percussion, and, as a late finding, tracheal deviation.
Alveolar rupture can allow air into the pulmonary venous circulation with subsequent arterial gas embolism, which is particularly dangerous when it involves the brain, but can also affect other organs (eg, spinal cord, heart, skin, kidneys, spleen, gastrointestinal tract).
Compression of the lungs may occur during very deep descent in breath-hold diving; compression may rarely decrease lung volume below residual volume, causing mucosal edema, vascular engorgement, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage, which manifest clinically as dyspnea and hemoptysis on ascent.
Diagnosis of Pulmonary Barotrauma Chest imaging Chest x-ray is done to look for signs of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum (radiolucent band along the cardiac border).
If chest x-ray is negative but there is strong clinical suspicion, then chest CT, which may be more sensitive than plain film x-rays, may be diagnostic.
Ultrasound may also be useful for rapid bedside diagnosis of pneumothorax.
Factors increasing risk of pulmonary barotrauma include certain behaviors (eg, rapid ascent, breath-holding, breathing compressed air) and lung disorders (eg, COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]).
Pneumoperitoneum without a ruptured viscus should be suspected when pneumoperitoneum is present without peritoneal signs.
If patients have any neurologic deficits found on neurologic examination, arterial gas embolism to the brain should be suspected.
Treatment of Pulmonary Barotrauma 100% oxygen Sometimes tube thoracostomy Suspected tension pneumothorax is treated with needle decompression followed by tube thoracostomy.
If a smaller (eg, 10 to 20%) pneumothorax is present and there is no sign of hemodynamic or respiratory instability, the pneumothorax may resolve when high-flow 100% oxygen is given for 24 to 48 hours.
If this treatment is ineffective or if a larger pneumothorax is present, tube thoracostomy (using a pigtail catheter or small chest tube) is done.
No specific treatment is required for pneumomediastinum; symptoms usually resolve spontaneously within hours to days.
After a few hours of observation, most patients can be treated as outpatients; high-flow 100% oxygen is recommended to hasten resorption of extra-alveolar gas in these patients.
Rarely, mediastinotomy is required to relieve tension pneumomediastinum.
Prevention of Pulmonary Barotrauma Prevention of pulmonary barotrauma is usually the top priority.
Proper ascent timing and techniques are essential.
Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are common manifestations.
Patients at high risk for pneumothorax during diving include those with pulmonary bullae, Marfan syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or previous spontaneous pneumothorax.
Such individuals should not dive or work in areas of compressed air.
Patients with asthma may be at risk of pulmonary barotrauma, although many people with asthma can dive safely after they are evaluated and treated appropriately.
Patients with pneumomediastinum after a dive should be referred to a diving medicine specialist for assessment of risks of future dives.
After COVID-19 infection, some people develop lung pathology (such as bullae) that could increase their risk for pulmonary barotrauma while diving.
Proposed guidelines (1, 2) recommend spirometry and chest imaging for anyone who has had respiratory or cardiac symptoms (including chest pain, palpitations, significant cough, or dyspnea) due to COVID-19 infection Prevention references 1.
Diving Hyperb Med 52 (1): 66 - 67, 2022. doi: 10.28920 / dhm52.1.66 - 67 Key Points Although rare, pulmonary barotrauma can result in tension pneumothorax, which must be immediately decompressed.
Patients require neurologic examination and chest imaging.
Examine all patients who have pulmonary barotrauma for signs of brain dysfunction, which suggests arterial gas embolism.
Treat all patients with suspected pulmonary barotrauma with 100% oxygen pending diagnostic testing.
Pneumothorax is treated.
Prevention involves decreasing risky behaviors and counseling high-risk divers.
Overexpansion and alveolar rupture can occur when breath holding occurs (usually while breathing compressed air) during ascent, particularly rapid ascent.
The result can be Pneumothorax (causing dyspnea, chest pain, and unilateral decrease in breath sounds) Pneumomediastinum (causing sensation of fullness in the chest, neck pain, pleuritic chest pain that may radiate to the shoulders, dyspnea, coughing, hoarseness, and dysphagia).
Ear and Sinus Barotrauma By Richard E Moon, MD, Duke University Medical Center Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Key Points More Information Barotrauma is tissue injury caused by a pressure-related change in body compartment gas volume.
When pressure within the middle ear remains elevated during or after ascent from a dive, the facial nerve can be compressed (facial baroparesis), resulting in ipsilateral upper and lower facial paresis.
Weakness of both upper and lower face distinguishes facial baroparesis from stroke or arterial gas embolism (1).
Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT) occurs due to rupture of the labyrinthine window (round or oval window) or tears of the Reissner, basilar, or tectorial membranes.
Symptoms, which include tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness, disequilibrium, vertigo, nystagmus, ataxia, nausea, and vomiting, often worsen with activity and loud noise, and improve with rest.
Symptoms usually start during descent when there is difficulty equalizing middle ear pressure, but can occur during ascent, possibly due to air expansion within the cochlea or vestibular apparatus.
Symptoms can also occur days after a dive, often provoked by lifting or straining (2).
Sinus barotrauma most often affects the frontal sinuses, followed by the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses (3).
Divers experience mild pressure to severe pain, with a feeling of congestion in the involved sinus compartments during ascent or descent and sometimes epistaxis.
Pain can be severe, sometimes accompanied by facial tenderness on palpation.
Maxillary sinus overpressurization can compress the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, causing hyperesthesia over the cheek.
It can affect the ear (causing ear pain, hearing loss, and / or vestibular symptoms) or the sinuses (causing pain and congestion).
Overpressurization in the sphenoid sinus occasionally compresses the optic nerve, causing decreased vision or blindness (3, 4).
Rarely, the sinus may rupture and cause pneumocephalus with facial or oral pain, nausea, vertigo, or headache.
Rupture of a maxillary sinus can cause retro-orbital air with diplopia due to oculomotor dysfunction.
Compression of the trigeminal nerve in the maxillary sinus can cause facial paresthesias.
Physical examination may detect tenderness in the sinuses or nasal hemorrhage.
Barotrauma can also occur due to the reduction in ambient pressure during ascent to altitude.
Diagnosis sometimes requires audiometry and vestibular testing.
PMID: 9830365 PMCID: PMC1305327 Diagnosis of Ear and Sinus Barotrauma Clinical evaluation Sometimes, audiometry and vestibular testing Barotrauma causing only pain in the ear or sinuses is usually diagnosed clinically.
Patients with symptoms of inner ear barotrauma (eg, tinnitus, hearing loss, or vertigo) should be examined for signs of vestibular dysfunction and undergo urgent formal audiometry, vestibular testing, and possibly surgery.
Treatment, when required, may involve decongestants, analgesics, and sometimes oral corticosteroids or surgical repair of serious inner or middle ear or sinus injuries.
These patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist because prompt surgical treatment of labyrinthine window tears can reverse hearing loss.
Imaging (eg, plain x-rays, CT) is not necessary for diagnosis of uncomplicated sinus barotrauma, but CT is useful if sinus rupture or cranial nerve compression is suspected.
Treatment of Ear and Sinus Barotrauma Decongestants and analgesics Sometimes oral corticosteroids, surgical repair, or both Most ear and sinus barotrauma injuries resolve spontaneously and require only symptomatic treatment and outpatient follow-up.
Treatment with medications for sinus and middle ear barotrauma is identical.
Decongestants (usually oxymetazoline 0.05%, 2 sprays each nostril twice a day for 3 to 5 days or pseudoephedrine 30 to 60 mg orally 2 to 4 times a day up to a maximum of 240 mg / day for 3 to 5 days) can help open occluded chambers.
Severe cases can be treated with nasal corticosteroids.
Pain can be controlled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids.
If bleeding or evidence of effusion is present, antibiotics are given (eg, amoxicillin 500 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole 1 double-strength tablet orally twice a day for 10 days).
For middle ear barotrauma, some physicians also advocate a short course of oral corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 mg orally once a day for 6 days, then tapered over 7 to 10 days).
Referral to an otorhinolaryngologist is indicated for severe or persistent symptoms.
Urgent surgery (eg, tympanotomy for direct repair of a ruptured round or oval window, myringotomy to drain fluid from the middle ear, sinus decompression) may be necessary for serious inner or middle ear or sinus injuries.
Prevention of Ear and Sinus Barotrauma During a dive, ear barotrauma during descent may be avoided by frequently swallowing or exhaling against pinched nostrils to open the eustachian tubes and equalize pressure between the middle ear and the environment.
Pressure behind ear plugs cannot be equalized, so they should not be used for diving.
Prophylaxis with oxymetazoline 0.05% nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril twice daily or pseudoephedrine 30 to 60 mg orally 2 or 4 times a day up to a maximum of 240 mg / day, beginning 12 to 24 hours before a dive, can reduce the incidence of ear and sinus barotrauma.
Diving should not be done if congestion does not resolve or if an upper respiratory infection or uncontrolled allergic rhinitis is present.
Key Points If patients have tinnitus, hearing loss, or vertigo, arrange urgent audiometry and vestibular testing.
Consider CT if unsure of clinical assessment or if sinus injury is complicated by cranial nerve compression.
If symptoms are severe, prescribe an analgesic and a decongestant.
Decrease risk of ear and sinus barotrauma by counseling against diving when the nose is congested and sometimes by prescribing prophylactic oxymetazoline or nasal pseudoephedrine.
Typically, divers experience ear fullness and pain during descent; if pressure is not quickly equilibrated, middle ear hemorrhage or tympanic membrane rupture may occur.
Inflow of cold water to the middle ear may result in vertigo, nausea, and disorientation while submerged.
On examination of the ear canal, the tympanic membrane may show congestion, hemotympanum, perforation, or lack of mobility during air insufflation with a pneumatic otoscope; conductive hearing loss is usually present.
It can also result from excessive release of thyroid hormone from the thyroid without increased synthesis.
The other causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism are the same as those for clinically apparent hyperthyroidism.
Patients with serum TSH < 0.1 microU / mL (0.1 mU / L) have an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (particularly older patients), reduced bone mineral density, increased fractures, and increased mortality.
Patients with serum TSH that is only slightly below normal are less likely to have these features.
Treatment of Hyperthyroidism Treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on cause (1) but may include Radioactive iodine Methimazole or propylthiouracil Beta-blockers Iodine Surgery Radioactive sodium iodine (iodine-131, radioiodine) In the United States, iodine-131 is the most common treatment for hyperthyroidism.
Radioiodine is often recommended as the treatment of choice for Graves disease and toxic nodular goiter in all patients, including children.
Dosage of iodine-131 is difficult to adjust because the response of the gland cannot be predicted; some physicians give a standard dose of 8 to 15 millicurie.
Others adjust the dose based on estimated thyroid size and the 24-hour uptake to provide a dose of 80 to 120 microcurie / g thyroid tissue.
When sufficient iodine-131 is given to cause euthyroidism, about 25 to 50% of patients become hypothyroid 1 year later, and the incidence continues to increase yearly.
Thus, most patients eventually become hypothyroid.
Such release is commonly caused by the destructive changes of various types of thyroiditis.
Larger doses, such as 10 to 20 millicurie, often cause hypothyroidism within 6 months, and thus ablative therapy (ie, iodine-131) has become the preferred approach.
Radioactive iodine is not used during lactation because it can enter breast milk and cause hypothyroidism in the infant.
It is not used during pregnancy because it crosses the placenta and can cause severe fetal hypothyroidism.
There is no proof that radioiodine increases the incidence of tumors, leukemia, thyroid cancer, or birth defects in children born to previously hyperthyroid women who become pregnant later in life.
Methimazole and propylthiouracil These antithyroid drugs block thyroid peroxidase, decreasing the organification of iodide, and impair the coupling reaction.
Propylthiouracil in high doses also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
Methimazole is the preferred drug.
The usual starting dosage of methimazole is 5 to 20 mg orally 2 or 3 times a day.
Normalization of TSH lags normalization of T4 and T3 levels by one or more weeks.
Therefore, when T4 and T3 levels normalize, the dosage is decreased to the lowest effective amount, usually methimazole 2.5 to 10 mg once a day in order to avoid inducing hypothyroidism.
The most common causes overall include Graves disease Multinodular goiter Thyroiditis Single, autonomous, hyperfunctioning "hot" nodule Graves disease (toxic diffuse goiter), the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is characterized by hyperthyroidism and one or more of the following: Goiter Exophthalmos Infiltrative dermopathy Graves disease is caused by an autoantibody against the thyroid receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); unlike most autoantibodies, which are inhibitory, this autoantibody is stimulatory, thus causing continuous synthesis and secretion of excess T4 and T3.
Maintenance doses of methimazole may be continued for one or many years depending on the clinical circumstances.
Carbimazole, which is used widely in Europe but is unavailable in the US, is rapidly converted to methimazole.
The usual starting dose is similar to that of methimazole; maintenance dosage is 2.5 to 10 mg orally once a day or 2.5 to 5 mg twice a day.
Because of severe liver failure in some patients < age 40, especially children, propylthiouracil is recommended only in special situations (eg, in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, in thyroid storm).
The usual starting dose of propylthiouracil is 100 to 150 mg orally every 8 hours.
Rapid control can be achieved by increasing the dosage of propylthiouracil to 150 to 200 mg every 8 hours.
Such dosages or higher ones (up to 400 mg every 8 hours) are generally reserved for severely ill patients, including those with thyroid storm, to block the conversion of T4 to T3.
Maintenance dosing with propylthiouracil is 50 mg twice a day or 3 times a day About 20 to 50% of patients with Graves disease remain in remission after a 1 - to 2-year course of either drug.
The return to normal or a marked decrease in gland size, the restoration of a normal serum TSH level, and less severe hyperthyroidism before therapy are good prognostic signs of long-term remission.
Graves disease (like Hashimoto thyroiditis) sometimes occurs with other autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, premature graying of hair, pernicious anemia, connective tissue disorders, and polyglandular deficiency syndrome.
The concomitant use of antithyroid drug therapy and levothyroxine does not improve the remission rate in patients with Graves disease.
Because toxic nodular goiter rarely goes into remission, antithyroid drug therapy is given only in preparation for surgical treatment or iodine-131 therapy.
Adverse effects include rash, allergic reactions, abnormal liver function (including hepatic failure with propylthiouracil), and, in about 0.1% of patients, reversible agranulocytosis.
Patients allergic to one drug can be switched to the other, but cross-sensitivity may occur.
If agranulocytosis occurs, the patient cannot be switched to the other drug; other therapy (eg, radioiodine, surgery) should be used.
Pearls & Pitfalls If agranulocytosis occurs with one of the antithyroid peroxidase drugs (methimazole or propylthiouracil), avoid using another drug in the same class; use another therapy (eg, radioiodine, surgery) instead.
Potential adverse effects or other characteristics vary between the two drugs and guide the indications for each.
Methimazole need only be given once a day, which improves adherence.
Furthermore, when methimazole is used in dosages of < 20 mg a day, agranulocytosis is less common; with propylthiouracil, agranulocytosis may occur at any dosage.
Methimazole has been used successfully in pregnant and nursing women without fetal or infant complications, but rarely methimazole has been associated with scalp and gastrointestinal defects in neonates and with a rare embryopathy.
Heredity increases the risk of Graves disease, although the genes involved are unknown.
Because of these complications, propylthiouracil is used in the 1st trimester of pregnancy.
Propylthiouracil is preferred for the treatment of thyroid storm, because the high dosages used (over 800 mg a day) partially block the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 in addition to decreasing production in the thyroid.
The combination of high-dose propylthiouracil and dexamethasone, also a potent inhibitor of T4 to T3 conversion, can relieve symptoms of severe hyperthyroidism as seen in patients with thyroid storm and restore the serum T3 level to normal within a week.
Beta-blockers Symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism due to adrenergic stimulation may respond to beta-blockers; propranolol has had the greatest use, but atenolol or metoprolol may be preferable.
Manifestations typically responding to beta-blockers: Tachycardia, tremor, mental symptoms, eyelid lag; occasionally heat intolerance and sweating, diarrhea, proximal myopathy Manifestations typically not responding to beta-blockers: goiter, exophthalmos, weight loss, bruit, increased oxygen consumption, and increased circulating thyroxine levels Propranolol is indicated in thyroid storm (see table Treatment of Thyroid Storm).
It rapidly decreases heart rate, usually within 2 to 3 hours when given orally and within minutes when given intravenously.
Esmolol should be used only in the intensive care unit because it requires careful titration and monitoring.
Beta-blockers are also indicated for tachycardia with hyperthyroidism, especially in older patients, because antithyroid drugs usually take several weeks to become fully effective.
Calcium channel blockers may control tachyarrhythmias in patients in whom beta-blockers are contraindicated.
The pathogenesis of infiltrative ophthalmopathy (responsible for the exophthalmos in Graves disease) is poorly understood but may result from immunoglobulins directed to the TSH receptors in the orbital fibroblasts and fat that result in release of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammation, and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.
Iodine Iodine in pharmacologic doses inhibits the release of T3 and T4 within hours and inhibits the organification of iodine, a transitory effect lasting from a few days to a week, after which inhibition usually ceases.
Iodine is used for emergency management of thyroid storm, for hyperthyroid patients undergoing emergency nonthyroid surgery, and (because it also decreases the vascularity of the thyroid) for preoperative preparation of hyperthyroid patients undergoing thyroidectomy.
Iodine generally is not used for routine treatment of hyperthyroidism.
The usual dosage is 2 to 3 drops (100 to 150 mg) of a saturated potassium iodide solution orally 3 times a day or 4 times a day or sodium iodide in 1 L 0.9% saline solution 0.5 to 1 g IV given slowly once a day.
Complications of iodine therapy include inflammation of the salivary glands, conjunctivitis, and rash.
Surgery Surgery is indicated for patients with Graves disease whose hyperthyroidism has recurred after courses of antithyroid drugs and who refuse iodine-131 therapy, patients who cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs, patients with very large goiters, and in some younger patients with toxic adenoma and multinodular goiter.
Surgery may be done in older patients with giant nodular goiters.
Postoperative recurrences vary between 2 and 16%; risk of hypothyroidism is directly related to the extent of surgery.
Vocal cord paralysis and hypoparathyroidism are uncommon complications.
Ophthalmopathy may also occur before the onset of hyperthyroidism or as late as 20 years afterward and frequently worsens or abates independently of the clinical course of hyperthyroidism.
Saturated solution of potassium iodide 3 drops (about 100 to 150 mg) orally 3 times a day should be given for 10 days before surgery to reduce the vascularity of the gland.
Methimazole must be given first because the patient should be euthyroid before iodide is given.
Dexamethasone can be added to rapidly restore euthyroidism.
Surgical procedures on the anterior neck are more difficult in patients who previously underwent thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy.
Treatment of thyroid storm A treatment regimen for thyroid storm is shown in the table Treatment of Thyroid Storm.
Table Treatment of infiltrative dermopathy and ophthalmopathy In infiltrative dermopathy (in Graves disease), topical corticosteroids or corticosteroid injections into the lesions may decrease the dermopathy.
Dermopathy sometimes remits spontaneously after months or years.
Ophthalmopathy should be treated jointly by the endocrinologist and ophthalmologist and may require selenium, corticosteroids, orbital radiation, and surgery.
Surgical thyroidectomy may help resolve or prevent progression of ophthalmopathy.
Typical ophthalmopathy in the presence of normal thyroid function is called euthyroid Graves disease.
Teprotumumab, an insulin - like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor inhibitor, is very effective therapy for moderately severe ophthalmopathy (2).
Radioiodine therapy may accelerate progression of ophthalmopathy when ophthalmopathy is active, and is thus contraindicated in this active phase.
Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism In patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism who are taking levothyroxine, reduction of the dose is the most appropriate management unless therapy is aimed at maintaining suppressed TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer.
Therapy is indicated for patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism (serum TSH < 0.1 mU / L), especially those with atrial fibrillation or reduced bone mineral density.
The usual treatment is iodine-131, but low doses of methimazole are also effective.
Toxic solitary or multinodular goiter (Plummer disease) sometimes results from TSH receptor gene mutations causing continuous thyroid activation.
2020. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1910434 Key Points Hyperthyroidism has many causes; the most common etiology is Graves disease, caused by excessive hormone synthesis by an abnormal thyroid.
Other causes of hyperthyroidism include excessive stimulation of a normal thyroid gland (eg, by thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG], ingestion of iodine or iodine-containing drugs), excessive hormone synthesis by an abnormal thyroid (eg, toxic nodular goiter), excessive release of thyroid hormones (eg, due to thyroiditis), or ingestion of excessive quantities of thyroid hormone.
Symptoms and signs are many but include tachycardia, fatigue, weight loss, nervousness, and tremor; patients with Graves disease may also have exophthalmos and infiltrative dermopathy.
Free thyroxine (T4), and / or free or total triiodothyronine (T3) are elevated, and TSH is suppressed (except in rarer cases of pituitary causes of hyperthyroidism).
Hormone synthesis can be suppressed with methimazole (or in certain cases, propylthiouracil) and adrenergic symptoms relieved with beta-blockers; long-term treatment may require thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine or surgery.
Thyroid storm—resulting from untreated or inadequately treated severe hyperthyroidism—is a life-threatening emergency that presents with severe symptoms of hyperthyroidism and may result in cardiovascular collapse or shock; it is treated with a regimen of antithyroid drugs, iodine, and hemodynamic support.
Patients with toxic nodular goiter have none of the autoimmune manifestations or circulating antibodies observed in patients with Graves disease.
Also, in contrast to Graves disease, toxic solitary and multinodular goiters usually do not remit.
Inflammatory thyroid disease (thyroiditis) includes subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and silent lymphocytic thyroiditis, a variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Hyperthyroidism is more common in subacute granulomatous thyroiditis and results from destructive changes in the gland and release of stored hormone, not from increased synthesis.
Hypothyroidism may follow.
Inappropriate TSH secretion is a rare cause.
Patients with hyperthyroidism have essentially undetectable TSH except for those with a TSH-secreting anterior pituitary adenoma or pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone.
TSH levels are high, and the TSH produced in both disorders is biologically more active than normal TSH.
An increase in the alpha-subunit of TSH in the blood (helpful in differential diagnosis) occurs in patients with a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.
Drug-induced hyperthyroidism can result from amiodarone, checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer therapy, alemtuzumab used in treatment of multiple sclerosis, or interferon-alfa, which may induce thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism and other thyroid disorders.
Although more commonly causing hypothyroidism, lithium can rarely cause hyperthyroidism.
Patients receiving these drugs should be closely monitored.
Thyrotoxicosis factitia is hyperthyroidism resulting from intentional or accidental overingestion of thyroid hormone.
Excess iodine ingestion causes hyperthyroidism with a low thyroid radioactive iodine uptake.
It most often occurs in patients with underlying nontoxic nodular goiter (especially older patients) who are given drugs that contain iodine (eg, amiodarone) or who undergo radiologic studies using iodine-rich contrast agents.
The etiology may be that the excess iodine provides substrate for functionally autonomous (ie, not under TSH regulation) areas of the thyroid to produce hormone.
Hyperthyroidism usually persists as long as excess iodine remains in the circulation.
Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) and choriocarcinoma produce high levels of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a weak thyroid stimulator.
Levels of hCG are highest during the 1st trimester of pregnancy and result in the decrease in serum TSH and mild increase in serum free T4 sometimes observed at that time.
The increased thyroid stimulation may be caused by increased levels of partially desialated hCG, an hCG variant that appears to be a more potent thyroid stimulator than more sialated hCG.
Hyperthyroidism in molar pregnancy, choriocarcinoma, and hyperemesis gravidarum is transient; normal thyroid function resumes when the molar pregnancy is evacuated, the choriocarcinoma is appropriately treated, or the hyperemesis gravidarum abates.
Symptoms include palpitations, fatigue, weight loss, heat intolerance, anxiety, and tremor.
Nonautoimmune autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism manifests during infancy.
It results from mutations in the TSH receptor gene that produce continuous thyroid stimulation.
Metastatic thyroid cancer is a possible cause.
Overproduction of thyroid hormone occurs rarely from functioning metastatic follicular carcinoma, especially in pulmonary metastases.
Struma ovarii develops when ovarian teratomas contain enough thyroid tissue to cause true hyperthyroidism.
Radioactive iodine uptake occurs in the pelvis, and uptake by the thyroid is usually suppressed.
Pathophysiology of Hyperthyroidism In hyperthyroidism, serum T3 usually increases more than does T4, probably because of increased secretion of T3 as well as conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues.
In some patients, only T3 is elevated (T3 toxicosis).
T3 toxicosis may occur in any of the common disorders that cause hyperthyroidism, including Graves disease, multinodular goiter, and the autonomously functioning solitary thyroid nodule.
If T3 toxicosis is untreated, the patient usually also develops laboratory abnormalities typical of hyperthyroidism (ie, elevated T4 and iodine-123 uptake).
Diagnosis is clinical and with thyroid function tests.
The various forms of thyroiditis commonly have a hyperthyroid phase followed by a hypothyroid phase.
Symptoms and Signs of Hyperthyroidism Most symptoms and signs are the same regardless of the cause.
Exceptions include infiltrative ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, which occur only in Graves disease.
Pearls & Pitfalls Older adults with hyperthyroidism may have symptoms more akin to depression or dementia.
The clinical presentation may be dramatic or subtle.
A goiter or nodule may be present.
Many common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are due to enhanced sensitivity to adrenergic hormones, such as nervousness, palpitations, hyperactivity, increased sweating, heat hypersensitivity, fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, weakness, and frequent bowel movements (occasionally diarrhea).
Hypomenorrhea may be present.
Signs may include warm, moist skin, tremor, tachycardia, widened pulse pressure, and atrial fibrillation.
Older patients, particularly those with toxic nodular goiter, may present atypically (apathetic or masked hyperthyroidism) with symptoms more akin to depression or dementia.
Most do not have exophthalmos or tremor.
Atrial fibrillation, syncope, altered sensorium, heart failure, and weakness are more likely.
Symptoms and signs may involve only a single organ system.
Eye signs include stare, eyelid lag, eyelid retraction, and mild conjunctival injection and are largely due to excessive adrenergic stimulation.
They usually remit with successful treatment.
Infiltrative ophthalmopathy, a more serious development, is specific to Graves disease and can occur years before or after hyperthyroidism.
It is characterized by orbital pain, lacrimation, irritation, photophobia, increased retro-orbital tissue, exophthalmos, and lymphocytic infiltration of the extraocular muscles, causing ocular muscle weakness that frequently leads to double vision.

Edited by R Miller (series editor) and JL Lichtor.
Infiltrative dermopathy, also called pretibial myxedema (a confusing term, because myxedema suggests hypothyroidism), is characterized by nonpitting infiltration by proteinaceous ground substance, usually in the pretibial area.
It rarely occurs in the absence of Graves ophthalmopathy.
The lesion is often pruritic and erythematous in its early stages and subsequently becomes brawny.
Infiltrative dermopathy may appear years before or after hyperthyroidism.
Thyroid storm Thyroid storm is an acute form of hyperthyroidism that results from untreated or inadequately treated severe hyperthyroidism.
It is rare, occurring in patients with Graves disease or toxic multinodular goiter (a solitary toxic nodule is a less common cause and generally causes less severe manifestations).
It may be precipitated by infection, trauma, surgery, embolism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or preeclampsia.
Thyroid storm causes abrupt florid symptoms of hyperthyroidism with one or more of the following: fever, marked weakness and muscle wasting, extreme restlessness with wide emotional swings, confusion, psychosis, coma, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatomegaly with mild jaundice.
Hyperthyroidism can be classified on the basis of thyroid radioactive iodine uptake and the presence or absence of circulating thyroid stimulators (see table).
The patient may present with cardiovascular collapse and shock.
Thyroid storm is a life-threatening emergency requiring prompt treatment.
Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism TSH Free T4, plus either free T3 or total T3 Sometimes radioactive iodine uptake Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based on history, physical examination, and thyroid function tests.
Serum TSH measurement is the best test because TSH is suppressed in hyperthyroid patients except in the rare instance when the etiology is a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma or pituitary resistance to the normal inhibition by thyroid hormone.
Free T4 is increased in hyperthyroidism.
However, T4 can be falsely normal in true hyperthyroidism in patients with a severe systemic illness (similar to the falsely low levels that occur in euthyroid sick syndrome) and in T3 toxicosis.
If free T4 level is normal and TSH is low in a patient with subtle symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism, then serum T3 should be measured to detect T3 toxicosis; an elevated level confirms that diagnosis.
The cause can often be diagnosed clinically (eg, the presence of signs specific to Graves disease).
If not, radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid may be measured by using iodine-123.
When hyperthyroidism is due to hormone overproduction, radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid is usually elevated.
Etiology of Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism may result from increased synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) from the thyroid, caused by thyroid stimulators in the blood or by autonomous thyroid hyperfunction.
When hyperthyroidism is due to thyroiditis, iodine ingestion, or overtreatment with thyroid hormones, radioactive iodine uptake is low.
TSH receptor antibodies can be measured to evaluate for Graves disease.
Measurement is done in pregnant women with a history of Graves disease during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to assess the risk of neonatal Graves disease; TSH receptor antibodies readily cross the placenta to stimulate the fetal thyroid.
Most patients with Graves disease have circulating antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and fewer have antithyroglobulin antibodies.
Inappropriate TSH secretion is uncommon.
The diagnosis is confirmed when hyperthyroidism occurs with elevated circulating free T4 and T3 concentrations and normal or elevated serum TSH.
If thyrotoxicosis factitia is suspected, serum thyroglobulin can be measured; it is usually low or low-normal—unlike in all other causes of hyperthyroidism.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism Subclinical hyperthyroidism is low serum TSH in patients with normal serum free T4 and T3 and absent or minimal symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism is far less common than subclinical hypothyroidism.
Many patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are taking levothyroxine.
Riot-Control Chemical Agents By James M Madsen, MD, MPH, U S.Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Riot-control agents are compounds that were initially developed for crowd control but that have also been used in military conflicts (see also Overview of Chemical-Warfare Agents).
DM is thought to exert its effects partly via the oxidation of its arsenic moiety from As (III) to As (V) and the subsequent release of chlorine.
OC causes pain by binding to transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) receptors in neurons that are then stimulated to release neurokinin A, calcitonin - gene-related peptide, and substance P These compounds induce neurogenic inflammation associated with pain, capillary leakage, edema, mucous production, and bronchoconstriction.
Symptoms and Signs of Riot-Control Chemical Injuries Although there are minor differences between compounds, most riot-control agents cause nearly immediate irritation and pain involving the eyes, mucous membranes, and skin, which may also become briefly erythematous.
Respiratory effects resulting from inhalation are typically obviously audible (eg, coughing, sneezing, and wheezing) due to type 1 damage, although type 2 damage (delayed-onset shortness of breath due to incipient acute lung injury) can occur with high doses.
Deaths are usually due to pulmonary edema resulting from high doses delivered in confined spaces.
The largely obsolete agent DM may cause either immediate or delayed-onset irritation along with vomiting.
Effects of all of the riot-control agents typically resolve within a half an hour, although agent left on the skin may cause blisters.
Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) can occur long after exposure and persist indefinitely, although it is impossible to predict which patients will develop this complication.
Diagnosis of Riot-Control Chemical Injuries Clinical evaluation Diagnosis is made by history, signs (lacrimation, blepharospasm, erythema, type 1 respiratory signs), and symptoms (transient irritation and pain with, at high doses, delayed-onset shortness of breath or chest tightness).
Riot-control agents are also referred to as harassing agents, tear agents, or lacrimators and are often misleadingly called tear gas, but in fact they do not exist as gases or vapors.
Chest x-rays are usually clear and not needed unless patients develop dyspnea, which suggests pulmonary edema.
Laboratory studies do not contribute to diagnosis.
Evidence of incipient pulmonary edema should prompt urgent evacuation to a pulmonary intensive care unit.
Treatment of Riot-Control Chemical Injuries Termination of exposure Skin decontamination If eye pain does not resolve spontaneously, eye decontamination Cold compresses and analgesics if necessary for pain At the first sign of exposure or potential exposure, masks are applied when available.
People are removed from the affected area when possible.
Decontamination is by physical or mechanical removal (brushing, washing, rinsing) of solid or liquid agents.
Water may transiently exacerbate the pain caused by CS and OC but is still effective, although fat-containing oils or soaps may be more effective against OC.
Eyes are decontaminated by copious flushing with sterile water or saline or (with OC) open-eye exposure to wind from a fan.
Referral to an ophthalmologist is needed if slit-lamp examination shows impaction of solid particles of agent.
Instead, they are solids that can be dispersed as liquids (by dissolving the solid agent to form a solution and then spraying the solution) or as aerosols (small particles released explosively or as smoke).
Most effects resulting from riot-control agents are transient and do not require treatment beyond decontamination, and most patients do not need observation beyond 4 hours.
However, patients should be instructed to return if they develop effects such as vesication or delayed-onset shortness of breath.
Like anticholinergic agents, they are intended to cause incapacitation rather than serious injury or death, although deaths due to pulmonary edema (acute lung injury) have occurred.
Military versions of these agents include chloroacetophenone (CN, also marketed as Mace®), chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS), dibenzoxazepine (CR), and diphenylaminoarsine (adamsite, or DM, a so-called vomiting agent).
Oleoresin capsicum (OC, pepper spray) is a more recently developed riot-control agent used primarily for law enforcement and personal protection.
Chloropicrin (PS) is a compound used during World War I that is occasionally regarded as a riot-control agent, although it is more properly classified as a pulmonary agent.
Pathophysiology of Riot-Control Chemical Injuries CN and CS alkylate enzymes such as lactic dehydrogenase; this mechanism may be responsible for transient tissue injury that resolves with rapid replacement of the inactivated enzymes.
Release of cytokines such as bradykinin contributes to the pain caused by these compounds, as does generation of hydrochloric acid at high doses.
How To Reduce Anterior Shoulder Dislocations Using Traction-Countertraction By Matthew J Streitz, MD, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium Reviewed / Revised Sep 2022 View Patient Education Indications Contraindications Complications Equipment Additional Considerations Relevant Anatomy Positioning Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Aftercare Warnings and Common Errors Tips and Tricks Topic Resources Nerves, Arteries, and Ligaments... How To Reduce Anterior Shoulder... Traction-countertraction is often used to reduce anterior shoulder dislocations.
Contraindications to Traction-Countertraction Contraindications to simple closed reduction: Greater tuberosity fracture with > 1 cm displacement Significant Hill-Sachs deformity (≥ 20% humeral head deformity due to impaction against glenoid rim) Surgical neck fracture (below the greater and lesser tuberosities) Bankart fracture (anteroinferior glenoid rim) involving a bone fragment of over 20% and with glenohumeral instability Proximal humeral fracture of 2 or more parts These significant associated fractures require orthopedic evaluation and management, because of the risk of the procedure itself increasing displacement and injury severity.
Additional Considerations for Traction-Countertraction Reduction attempts are more likely to succeed if patients are calm and can relax their muscles.
Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is often needed if substantial pain, anxiety, and muscle spasms impede the procedure.
Relevant Anatomy for Traction-Countertraction In most anterior dislocations, the humeral head is trapped outside and against the anterior lip of the glenoid fossa.
The most commonly used traction-countertraction method requires one or more assistants, physical force, and occasionally, endurance.
Positioning for Traction-Countertraction Position the patient supine on the stretcher.
Step-by-Step Description of Traction-Countertraction Neurovascular examination Do a pre-procedure neurovascular examination of the affected arm, and repeat the examination after each reduction attempt.
Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) usually is needed.
Traction-countertraction is no longer a first-line method for reduction but is still somewhat popular, owing mainly to its high success rate, safety, operator comfort, and mostly, tradition.
Reduce the shoulder — Traction-countertraction Wrap a sheet around the patient's upper torso, passing the sheet under the axilla of the dislocated shoulder, and tie the ends of the sheet around the hips (not around the waist, which causes back strain) of the assistant standing at the opposite side of the stretcher.
Abduct the affected arm 45° and flex the elbow to 90°.
Wrap a 2nd sheet around the flexed forearm proximally and then around your hips.
With your arms straight, hold the affected forearm with both hands, maintaining forearm flexion.
Then, lean backward, which will apply traction to the patient's arm.
Simultaneously, have the assistant lean backward, creating the countertraction force to the axilla.
The body weight of you and your assistant, rather than arm strength, provides the continuous force required for this technique.
If the sheet rides up on the patient's forearm, correct for this situation by slightly increasing the forearm flexion.
The procedure may take many minutes to be successful.
Use gentle, limited external rotation to facilitate reduction if necessary.
If reduction does not occur, have a second assistant wrap a sheet around the affected humerus near the humeral head and apply a gentle lateral-cephalad force; this force leverages the distracted humeral head laterally towards the glenoid fossa.
How To Reduce Anterior Shoulder Dislocations: Traction-Countertraction VIDEO Aftercare for Traction-Countertraction Successful reduction is preliminarily confirmed by restoration of a normal round shoulder contour, decreased pain, and by the patient's renewed ability to reach across the chest and place the palm of the hand upon the opposite shoulder.
Warnings and Common Errors for Traction-Countertraction Apparent shoulder dislocation in a child is often a fracture involving the growth plate, which tends to fracture before the joint is disrupted.
Allow sufficient time for muscle spasm to resolve before proceeding through the procedure; too-rapid reduction is a common cause of failure with this technique.
Tips and Tricks for Traction-Countertraction Wrapping the sheets around the operators' hips (instead of the waist) prevents back strain.
Tying the sheet using a proper square knot decreases the chance of the sheet untying during the procedure.
Adequate sedation and pain control are key.
Indications for Traction-Countertraction Anterior dislocation of the shoulder Reduction should be attempted soon (eg, within 30 minutes) after the diagnosis is made.
If a neurovascular deficit is suspected, a less forceful method is preferred.
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma By Douglas J Rhee, MD, University Hospitals / Case Western Reserve University Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Etiology Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Eye: Anterior and Posterior... Normal Optic Nerve Glaucoma (Moderate) Glaucoma (Advanced) Glaucoma (Optic Disk Hemorrhage) Medications Used to Treat... Primary open-angle glaucoma is a syndrome of optic nerve damage associated with an open anterior chamber angle and an elevated or sometimes average intraocular pressure (IOP).
In primary open-angle glaucoma, there is an abnormality of extracellular matrix in the part of the trabecular meshwork (TM) that is immediately adjacent to the Schlemm canal (called the juxtacanalicular TM) similar to accelerated aging; trabecular meshwork cellularity may also decrease.
Elevated-pressure glaucoma Two thirds of patients with glaucoma have elevated (> 21 mm Hg) IOP.
Aqueous humor drainage is inadequate, whereas production by the ciliary body is normal.
Identifiable mechanisms (ie, secondary open-angle glaucomas) are not present.
Secondary mechanisms include developmental anomalies, scarring caused by trauma or infection, and plugging of channels by detached iris pigment (ie, pigment dispersion syndrome) or abnormal protein deposits (eg, pseudoexfoliation syndrome).
Normal-pressure glaucoma or low-tension (low-pressure) glaucoma In at least one third of patients with glaucoma, IOP is within the average range, but optic nerve damage and visual field loss typical of glaucoma are present.
These patients have a higher incidence of vasospastic diseases (eg, migraines, Raynaud syndrome) than the general population, suggesting that a vascular disorder compromising blood flow to the optic nerve may play a role.
Glaucoma occurring with average-range IOP is more common among Asian patients. Symptoms and Signs of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Early primary open-angle glaucoma symptoms are uncommon.
Usually, the patient becomes aware of visual field loss only when optic nerve atrophy is marked; the typically asymmetric deficits contribute to delay in recognition.
Symptoms are a result of visual field loss.
However, some patients have complaints, such as missing stairs if their inferior visual field has been lost, noticing portions of words missing when reading, or having difficulty with driving earlier in the course of the disease.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be normal or high but is almost always higher in the eye with more optic nerve damage.
Optic nerve appearance The optic nerve head (ie, disk) is normally a slightly vertically elongated circle with a centrally located depression called the cup.
The neurosensory rim is the tissue between the margin of the cup and the edge of the disk, and is composed of the ganglion cell axons from the retina.
Characteristic optic nerve changes include Increased cup: disk ratio (particularly an increasing ratio over time) Thinning of the neurosensory rim Pitting or notching of the rim Nerve fiber layer hemorrhage that crosses the disk margin (ie, Drance hemorrhage or splinter hemorrhages) Vertical elongation of the cup Quick (ie, sharp change in the course of angulations in the exiting blood vessels [called bayoneting]) Thinning of the neurosensory rim (optic nerve or retinal nerve fiber layer) over time alone can be diagnostic of glaucoma regardless of the IOP or visual field and is the initial sign of damage in 40 to 60% of cases.
In other cases, the initial sign of damage is some visual field change.
Wedge-shaped dark areas may develop, reflecting damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer.
Visual field defects Visual field changes caused by lesions of the optic nerve include Nasal step defects (which do not cross the horizontal meridian—an imaginary horizontal line between the upper and lower parts of the visual field) Arcuate (arc-shaped) scotomata extending nasally from the blind spot Temporal wedge defects Paracentral scotomata In contrast, deficits of the more proximal visual pathways (ie, from the lateral geniculate nucleus to the occipital lobe) involve quadrants or hemispheres of the visual field; thus, deficits do not cross the vertical meridian.
Diagnosis of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Visual field testing Ophthalmoscopy Measurement of central corneal thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP) Exclusion of other optic neuropathies Diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma is suggested by the examination, but similar findings can result from other optic neuropathies (eg, caused by ischemia, cytomegalovirus infection, or vitamin B12 deficiency).
Diagnosis is by ophthalmoscopy, gonioscopy, visual field examination, and measurement of central corneal thickness and IOP.
Before a diagnosis of normal-pressure glaucoma can be established, the following factors may need to be ruled out: Inaccurate IOP readings Large diurnal fluctuations (causing intermittent normal readings) Optic nerve damage caused by previously resolved glaucoma (eg, a previously elevated IOP due to corticosteroid use or uveitis) Intermittent angle-closure glaucoma Other ocular or neurologic disorders that cause similar visual field defects Central corneal thickness is measured to help interpret the result of IOP measurement.
Optic disk photography or a detailed optic disk drawing is helpful for future comparison.
The frequency of follow-up examinations varies from weeks to months, depending on the patient's reliability, severity of the glaucoma, and response to treatment.
Treatment of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Decreasing intraocular pressure (IOP) 20 to 40% Initially, medications (eg, prostaglandin analogs such as latanoprost or tafluprost, beta-blockers such as timolol) Sometimes surgery, such as laser trabeculoplasty or guarded filtration procedure Vision lost by glaucoma cannot be recovered.
The goal is to prevent further optic nerve and visual field damage by lowering IOP.
The target level is 20 to 40% below pretreatment readings or the IOP at which damage is known to have occurred.
In general, the greater the damage caused by glaucoma, the lower the IOP must be to prevent further damage.
If damage progresses, the IOP goal is lowered further and additional therapy is initiated.
Initial treatment used to be medical therapy, proceeding to laser therapy and then incisional surgery if the target IOP is not met; however, subsequent evidence suggests that initial treatment with laser trabeculoplasty preserves visual fields and results in less frequent subsequent incisional glaucoma surgeries than treatment with medications (1).
Surgery may be the initial treatment if IOP is extremely high, the patient does not wish to use or has trouble adhering to medical therapy, or if there is significant visual field damage at presentation.
Treatment includes laser surgery and / or topical medications (eg, prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers) and often requires incisional surgery to increase aqueous drainage.
Medical therapy Multiple medications are available (see table).
Topical agents are preferred.
The most popular are prostaglandin analogs, followed by beta-blockers (particularly timolol).
Other medications include alpha-2-selective adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, rho kinase inhibitors, and cholinergic agonists.
Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are effective, but adverse effects limit their use.
Patients taking topical glaucoma medications should be taught passive eyelid closure with punctal occlusion to help reduce systemic absorption and associated adverse effects, although the effectiveness of these maneuvers is controversial.
Patients who have difficulty instilling drops directly onto the conjunctiva may place the drop on the nose just medial to the medial canthus, then roll the head slightly toward the eye so that the liquid flows into the eye.
Typically, to gauge effectiveness, clinicians start medications in one (one-eye trial) or both eyes.
Table Surgery Surgery for primary open-angle glaucoma and normal-pressure glaucoma includes laser trabeculoplasty, a guarded filtration procedure, and procedures that enhance only a portion of the drainage pathway.
Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) uses a pulsed double-frequency neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser.
(See also Overview of Glaucoma.)
SLT and argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) are equally effective initially, but SLT may have greater effectiveness in subsequent treatments.
SLT is emerging as the standard of care for the initial treatment for newly diagnosed patients.
Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may also be considered but is rarely used in lieu of SLT.
Laser energy is applied to either 180º or 360º of the trabecular meshwork to improve the drainage of aqueous humor.
Within 2 to 5 years, about 50% of patients require additional drug therapy or surgery because of insufficient IOP control.
A guarded filtration procedure is the most commonly used filtration procedure.
A hole is made in the limbal sclera (trabeculectomy), which is covered by a partial-thickness scleral flap that controls egress of aqueous from the eye to the subconjunctival space, forming a filtration bleb.
Adverse effects of glaucoma filtration surgery include acceleration of cataract growth, pressures that are too low, and transient accumulation of fluid in the choroidal space (ie, choroidal effusion) during the perioperative period.
Patients with trabeculectomies are at increased risk of bacterial endophthalmitis and should be instructed to report any symptoms or signs of bleb infection (blebitis) or endophthalmitis (eg, worsening vision, conjunctival hyperemia, pain) immediately.
Partial-thickness procedures bypass portions of the outflow pathways, unlike full-thickness procedures, even if guarded, that create a direct conduit between the anterior chamber and subconjunctival space.
Etiology of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Although open-angle glaucomas can have numerous causes (see table), 60 to 70% of cases in the United States have no identifiable cause and are termed primary open-angle glaucoma.
In general, trabecular meshwork bypass procedures appear to be safer but less effective than trabeculectomy: The ab externo approach (an approach from outside the eye), including viscocanalostomy, deep sclerectomy, and canaloplasty, involves a deep dissection of greater than > 98% thickness of the scleral passage, leaving a window of Descemet membrane and / or the inner wall of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork.
The canal is dilated by using a viscoelastic solution (in viscocanalostomy) or a microcatheter (in canaloplasty).
Deep sclerectomy generally relies on the formation of a conjunctival bleb.
In the ab interno approach (an approach from inside the eye), a device is used to remove (eg, with ab interno goniotomy or trabeculectomy) or bypass (eg, with some stent procedures) the trabecular meshwork, creating direct communication between the anterior chamber and collecting channels.
Ophthalmology 130 (2): 139 - 151. doi: 10.1016 / j. ophtha.2022.09.009 Key Points Primary open-angle glaucoma is usually related to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) but may occur with normal IOP.
Vision loss due to glaucoma cannot be recovered.
Begin diagnostic evaluation with ophthalmoscopy, measurement of IOP, and visual field testing.
Both eyes usually are affected, but typically not equally.
Aim to decrease IOP by 20 to 40%.
Begin treatment with laser surgery and / or topical medications (eg, prostaglandin analogs such as latanoprost or tafluprost, beta-blockers such as timolol).
Consider incisional surgery if laser surgery and / or topical medications are not effective or if visual loss is severe.
Risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma include Older age Positive family history Black race Thinner central corneal thickness Systemic hypertension Diabetes Myopia In Black people, glaucoma is more severe and develops at an earlier age, and blindness is 6 to 8 times more likely.
Pathophysiology of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Intraocular pressure (IOP) can be elevated or within the average range.
Trachoma (Egyptian Ophthalmia; Granular Conjunctivitis) By Zeba A Syed, MD, Wills Eye Hospital Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Trachomatous Inflammation—Follicu... Trachomatous Scarring (TS)... Trachomatous Trichiasis... Trachoma is a chronic conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and is characterized by progressive exacerbations and remissions.
The causative organism is Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, Ba, and C).
In the United States, trachoma is rare, occurring occasionally among American Indians and immigrants.
The disease occurs mainly in children, particularly those between the ages of 3 and 6.
Older children and adults are much less susceptible because of increased immunity and better personal hygiene.
Symptoms and Signs of Trachoma Trachoma usually affects both eyes.
It is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide.
Trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF): Characterized by 5 or more follicles in the upper tarsal conjunctiva Trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI): Characterized by pronounced inflammatory thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels Trachomatous scarring (TS): Characterized by scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva Trachomatous trichiasis (TT): Characterized by at least one eyelash rubbing the eyeball Corneal opacity (CO): Characterized by easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil Rarely, corneal neovascularization regresses completely without treatment, and corneal transparency is restored.
With treatment and healing, the conjunctiva becomes smooth and grayish white.
In a population survey in the Nile Delta of Egypt, 6.5% of adults had trachoma; of those, 13% had visual impairment and 8% were blind.
Diagnosis of Trachoma Clinical findings (eg, tarsal lymphoid follicles, linear conjunctival scars, corneal pannus) Diagnosis of trachoma is usually clinical because testing is rarely available in endemic areas.
Lymphoid follicles on the tarsal plate or along the corneal limbus, linear conjunctival scarring, and corneal pannus are considered diagnostic in the appropriate clinical setting.
C trachomatis can be isolated in culture or identified by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and immunofluorescence techniques, and testing should be done when it is readily available.
In resource limited-settings, testing may be limited to cases of diagnostic uncertainty.
In the early stage, minute basophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies within conjunctival epithelial cells in Giemsa-stained conjunctival scrapings differentiate trachoma from nonchlamydial conjunctivitis.
Inclusion bodies are also found in adult inclusion conjunctivitis, but the setting and developing clinical picture distinguish it from trachoma.
Initial symptoms are conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid edema, photophobia, and lacrimation.
Palpebral vernal conjunctivitis appears similar to trachoma in its follicular hypertrophic stage, but symptoms are different, milky flat-topped papillae are present, and eosinophils (not basophilic inclusion bodies) are found in the scrapings.
Treatment of Trachoma Antibiotics, preferably systemic but alternatively topical Surgery for eyelid deformities and / or corneal opacity SAFE (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, Environmental improvement) program in endemic areas The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that individual or sporadic cases of trachomatous inflammation-follicular be treated topically.
The WHO also recommends topical treatment for trachomatous inflammation-intense, but that systemic treatment should be considered.
Trachomatous scarring alone does not require treatment until it progresses to cause trachomatous trichiasis.
For systemic treatment, a single oral dose of azithromycin 20 mg / kg (maximum 1 g) is 78 to 95% effective.
Alternatives include erythromycin 500 mg twice daily for 14 days or doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 10 days (not to be used in pregnant or breastfeeding women or in children under the age of 8).
For topical treatment, tetracycline 1% ointment to both eyes twice a day for 6 weeks can be used.
The WHO recommends eyelid surgery for trachomatous trichiasis.
If corneal opacity has advanced into the central cornea, it is considered the stage of untreatable irreversible blindness.
Later, corneal neovascularization and scarring of the conjunctiva, cornea, and eyelids occur.
The procedure is complex, and the frequent and intense aftercare to prevent rejection and infection makes corneal transplant impractical for many patients in most resource-limited nations.
Trachoma control in endemic areas The WHO has endorsed a 4-step program for control of trachoma in endemic areas.
This program is known as SAFE: S urgery to correct eyelid deformities (eg, entropion and trichiasis) that place patients at risk of blindness A ntibiotics to treat individual patients and mass drug administration to reduce the disease burden in the community F acial cleanliness to reduce transmission from infected individuals E nvironmental improvement (eg, access to potable water and improved sanitation) to reduce transmission of disease and reinfection of patients In hyperendemic areas, mass administration to the entire community older than 6 months of a single oral dose of azithromycin 20 mg / kg (maximum 1 g) or tetracycline or erythromycin ophthalmic ointment applied twice daily for 5 consecutive days each month for 6 months has been effective as treatment and prophylaxis.
Endemic trachoma has been dramatically reduced by using community-wide oral azithromycin in a single dose or in repeated doses.
However, reinfection due to re-exposure is common in endemic areas.
Reinfections can be reduced with fly control; better access to clean water, washing, and sanitation; building more hygienic latrines; and moving livestock and latrines farther from family living quarters.
Key Points Trachoma is a chronic, exacerbating, and remitting chlamydial conjunctivitis that is common among children ages 3 through 6 in certain resource-limited areas worldwide.
Manifestations develop in stages and include conjunctivitis, formation of tarsal follicles, thickening and scarring of tarsal conjunctiva, trichiasis, and corneal neovascularization and scarring.
About 7% of patients develop decreased vision or blindness; trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide.
Diagnosis is usually clinical, but standard methods to detect chlamydia can be done when available.
For endemic areas, the World Health Organization also advocates corrective surgery, mass administration of antibiotics, emphasizing facial cleanliness, and environmental interventions to reduce transmission.
Trachoma is endemic in resource-limited parts of North Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Australia, and Southeast Asia, affecting 1.9 million people.
It is also the cause of about 1.4 percent of blindness worldwide (1).
Subconjunctival Hemorrhages By Zeba A Syed, MD, Wills Eye Hospital Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Topic Resources Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Subconjunctival hemorrhages are extravasations of blood beneath the conjunctiva.
Subconjunctival hemorrhages usually result from minor local trauma, straining, sneezing, or coughing; rarely, they occur spontaneously.
The extent and location of hyperemia can help determine etiology.
Diffuse hyperemia of the bulbar and tarsal conjunctivae is typical of conjunctivitis.
Subconjunctival hemorrhages alarm the patient but are of no pathologic significance except when associated with blood dyscrasia, which is rare, or facial or ocular injuries.
Subconjunctival hemorrhages are absorbed spontaneously, usually within 2 weeks.
Topical corticosteroids, antibiotics, vasoconstrictors, and compresses do not speed reabsorption; reassurance is adequate therapy.
Niacin Deficiency (Pellagra) By Larry E Johnson, MD, PhD, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Reviewed / Revised Nov 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Pellagrous Glove Casal Necklace Pellagrous Skin Changes... Pellagrous Skin Changes (Feet) Pellagrous Skin Changes (Hand) Dietary niacin deficiency (causing pellagra) is uncommon in countries with low rates of food insecurity.
Bound niacin, found in maize, is not assimilated in the gastrointestinal tract unless it has been previously treated with alkali, as when tortillas are prepared.
Corn protein is also deficient in tryptophan.
The high incidence of pellagra in India among people who eat millet with a high leucine content has led to the hypothesis that amino acid imbalance may contribute to deficiency.
Deficiencies of protein and many B vitamins commonly accompany primary niacin deficiency.
Secondary niacin deficiency may be due to diarrhea, cirrhosis, or alcohol use disorder.
Pellagra also may occur in carcinoid syndrome (tryptophan is diverted to form 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin) and in Hartnup disease (absorption of tryptophan by the intestine and kidneys is defective).
Symptoms and Signs of Niacin Deficiency Pellagra is characterized by skin, mucous membrane, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Advanced pellagra can cause a symmetric photosensitive rash, stomatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental aberrations.
Symptoms may appear alone or in combination.
Skin symptoms include several types of lesions, which are usually bilaterally symmetric.
Clinical manifestations include the three Ds: localized pigmented rash (dermatitis); gastroenteritis (diarrhea); and widespread neurologic deficits, including cognitive decline (dementia).
The distribution of lesions—at pressure points or sun-exposed skin—is more pathognomonic than the form of the lesions.
Lesions can develop in a glovelike distribution on the hands (pellagrous glove) or in a boot-shaped distribution on the feet and legs (pellagrous boot).
Sunlight causes Casal necklace and butterfly-shaped lesions on the face.

Pellagrous Skin Changes (Feet) This image shows hyperpigemented and hyperkerototic skin changes characterized by pellagra (niacin deficiency).
Diagnosis is usually clinical, and dietary supplementation (oral or, if needed, intramuscular) is usually successful.
Pellagrous Skin Changes (Hand) This image shows hyperpigemented and hyperkerototic skin changes characterized by pellagra (niacin deficiency).
Glossitis and stomatitis characterize acute deficiency.
As the deficiency progresses, the tongue and oral mucous membranes become reddened, followed by pain in the mouth, increased salivation, and edema of the tongue.
Ulcerations may appear, especially under the tongue, on the mucosa of the lower lip, and opposite the molar teeth.
Gastrointestinal symptoms early in the deficiency include burning in the pharynx and esophagus and abdominal discomfort and distention.
Later, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.
Diarrhea is often bloody because of bowel hyperemia and ulceration.
Central nervous system symptoms include psychosis, encephalopathy (characterized by impaired consciousness), and cognitive decline (dementia).
Psychosis is characterized by memory impairment, disorientation, confusion, and confabulation; the predominant symptom may be excitement, depression, mania, delirium, or paranoia.
Any relationship between niacin status and hypertension is uncertain.
Diagnosis of Niacin Deficiency Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of niacin deficiency is clinical and may be straightforward when skin and mouth lesions, diarrhea, delirium, and dementia occur simultaneously.
More often, the presentation is not so specific.
Differentiating the central nervous system changes from those in thiamin deficiency is difficult.
A history of a diet lacking niacin and tryptophan may help establish the diagnosis.
A favorable response to treatment with niacin can usually confirm it.
If available, laboratory testing can help confirm the diagnosis, particularly when the diagnosis is otherwise unclear.
Urinary excretion of N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) is decreased; < 0.8 mg / day (< 5.8 mcmol / day) suggests a niacin deficiency.
Treatment of Niacin Deficiency Nicotinamide and other nutrients Because multiple deficiencies are common, a balanced diet, including other B vitamins (particularly riboflavin and pyridoxine), is needed.
Nicotinamide is usually used to treat niacin deficiency, because nicotinamide, unlike nicotinic acid (the most common form of niacin), does not cause flushing, itching, burning, or tingling sensations.
Nicotinamide is given in doses of 250 to 500 mg orally daily.
Key Points Niacin deficiency can cause pellagra, mainly in countries with high rates of food insecurity.
Pellagra causes a photosensitivity rash, mucositis, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neuropsychiatric dysfunction.
Diagnose clinically if possible.
Use nicotinamide to treat the deficiency; a favorable response can confirm the diagnosis.
Dietary sources of niacin include liver, red meat, fish, poultry, legumes, and whole-grain or enriched cereals and breads.
Because dietary tryptophan can be metabolized to niacin, foods rich in tryptophan (eg, dairy products) can compensate for inadequate dietary niacin.
Etiology of Niacin Deficiency Primary niacin deficiency results from extremely inadequate intake of both niacin and tryptophan, which usually occurs in areas where maize (Indian corn) constitutes a substantial part of the diet.

Overview of Learning Disorders By Stephen Brian Sulkes, MD, Golisano Children's Hospital at Strong, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry Reviewed / Revised Feb 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment More Information Topic Resources Common Specific Learning... Overview of Learning Disorders Learning disorders are conditions that cause a discrepancy between potential and actual levels of academic performance as predicted by the person's intellectual abilities.
Specific learning disorders affect the ability to Understand or use spoken language Understand or use written language Understand and use numbers and reason using mathematical concepts Coordinate movements Focus attention on a task Thus, these disorders involve problems in reading, mathematics, spelling, written expression or handwriting, and understanding or using verbal and nonverbal language (see table Common Specific Learning Disorders).
Most learning disorders are complex or mixed, with deficits in more than one system.
Although the total number of children in the US with learning disorders is unknown, in the 2019 - 2020 school year, 7.3 million students (or 14% of all public school students) ages 3 to 21 in the US received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
Among students receiving special education services, 33% (or about 5% of all students) had specific learning disabilities (1).
Boys with learning disorders outnumber girls 5: 1.
Although formal diagnoses may help some children get assistance, characterizing different capabilities as disorders risks medicalizing them as somehow pathological.
The important thing is to identify people who need different or additional help learning and provide access to the assistance they need.
Overview of Learning Disorders VIDEO Learning disorders may be congenital or acquired.
No single cause has been defined, but neurologic deficits are presumed to be involved whether or not other neurologic manifestations (ie, apart from the learning disorder) are present.
Genetic influences are often implicated.
Learning disorders involve impairments or difficulties in concentration or attention, language development, or visual and aural information processing.
Child Abuse Negl 106: 104485, 2020. doi: 10.1016 / j. chiabu.2020.104485 Symptoms and Signs of Learning Disorders Children with learning disorders typically have at least average intelligence, although such disorders can occur in children with lower cognitive function as well.
Symptoms and signs of severe learning disorders may manifest at an early age, but most mild to moderate learning disorders are not recognized until school age, when the rigors of academic learning are encountered.
Academic impairments Affected children may have trouble learning the alphabet and may be delayed in paired associative learning (eg, color naming, labeling, counting, letter naming).
Diagnosis includes cognitive, educational, speech and language, medical, and psychologic evaluations.
Speech perception may be limited, language may be learned at a slower rate, and vocabulary may be decreased.
Affected children may not understand what is read, have very messy handwriting or hold a pencil awkwardly, have trouble organizing or beginning tasks or retelling a story in sequential order, or confuse math symbols and misread numbers.
Executive function impairments Disturbances or delays in expressive language or listening comprehension are predictors of academic problems beyond the preschool years.
Memory may be defective, including short-term and long-term memory, memory use (eg, rehearsal), and verbal recall or retrieval.
Problems may occur in conceptualizing, abstracting, generalizing, reasoning, and organizing and planning information for problem solving.
People with executive function problems often have difficulty organizing and completing assignments.
Visual perception and auditory processing problems may occur; they include difficulties in spatial cognition and orientation (eg, object localization, spatial memory, awareness of position and place), visual attention and memory, and sound discrimination and analysis.
Behavior problems Some children with learning disabilities have difficulty following social conventions (eg, taking turns, standing too close to the listener, not understanding jokes); these difficulties are often components of mild autism spectrum disorders as well.
Short attention span, motor restlessness, fine motor problems (eg, poor printing and copying), and variability in performance and behavior over time are other early signs.
Difficulties with impulse control, non-goal-directed behavior and overactivity, discipline problems, aggressiveness, withdrawal and avoidance behavior, excessive shyness, and excessive fear may occur.
Treatment consists primarily of educational management and sometimes medical, behavioral, and psychologic therapy.
Learning disabilities and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often occur together.
Diagnosis of Learning Disorders Cognitive, educational, medical, and psychologic evaluations Clinical criteria Children with learning disorders are typically identified when a discrepancy is recognized between academic potential and academic performance.
Speech and language, cognitive, educational, medical, and psychologic evaluations are necessary for determining deficiencies in skills and cognitive processes.
Social and emotional-behavioral evaluations are also necessary for planning treatment and monitoring progress.
Evaluation Cognitive evaluation typically includes verbal and nonverbal intelligence testing and is usually done by a school psychologist.
Psychoeducational testing may be helpful in describing the child's preferred manner of processing information (eg, holistically or analytically, visually or aurally).
Neuropsychologic assessment is particularly useful in children with known central nervous system injury or illness to map the areas of the brain that correspond to specific functional strengths and weaknesses.
Speech and language evaluations establish integrity of comprehension and language use, phonologic processing, and verbal memory and can also assess pragmatic (social) language.
Educational assessment and performance evaluation by teachers' observations of classroom behavior and determination of academic performance are essential.
Reading evaluations measure abilities in word decoding and recognition, comprehension, and fluency.
Writing samples should be obtained to evaluate spelling, syntax, and fluency of ideas.
Mathematical ability should be assessed in terms of computation skills, knowledge of operations, understanding of concepts, and interpretation of "word problems"
Medical evaluation includes a detailed family history, the child's medical history, a physical examination, and a neurologic or neurodevelopmental examination to look for underlying disorders.
Although infrequent, physical abnormalities and neurologic signs may indicate medically treatable causes of learning disabilities.
Gross motor coordination problems may indicate neurologic deficits or neurodevelopmental delays.
Developmental level is evaluated according to standardized criteria.
Psychologic evaluation helps identify ADHD, conduct disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, and poor self-esteem, which frequently accompany and must be differentiated from learning disabilities.
Attitude toward school, motivation, peer relationships, and self-confidence are assessed.
Clinical criteria Diagnosis of learning disorders is made clinically based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), and requires evidence that at least one of the following has been present for ≥ 6 months despite targeted intervention: Inaccurate, slow and / or effortful word reading Difficulty understanding the meaning of written material Difficulty spelling Difficulty writing (eg, multiple grammar and punctuation errors; ideas not expressed clearly) Difficulty mastering number sense (eg, understanding the relative magnitude and relationship of numbers; in older children, difficulty doing simple calculations) Difficulty with mathematical reasoning (eg, using mathematical concepts to solve problems) Skills must be substantially below the level expected for the child's age and also significantly impair performance at school or in daily activities.
Also, the difficulties should not be better accounted for by intellectual disability or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
Neurodevelopmental disorders are neurologically based conditions that appear early in childhood, typically before school entry.
Treatment of Learning Disorders Educational management Medical, behavioral, and psychologic therapy Occasionally drug therapy Treatment of learning disorders centers on educational management but may also involve medical, behavioral, and psychologic therapy.
Effective teaching programs may take a remedial, compensatory, or strategic (ie, teaching the child how to learn) approach.
A mismatch of instructional method and a child's learning disorder and learning preference aggravates the disability.
Some children require specialized instruction in only one area while they continue to attend regular classes.
Other children need separate and intense educational programs.
Optimally and as required by US law, affected children should participate as much as possible in inclusive classes with peers who do not have learning disabilities.
Drugs minimally affect academic achievement, intelligence, and general learning ability, although certain drugs (eg, psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and several amphetamine preparations) may enhance attention and concentration, allowing children to respond more efficiently to instruction.
Many popular remedies and therapies (eg, eliminating food additives, using antioxidants or megadoses of vitamins, patterning by sensory stimulation and passive movement, sensory integrative therapy through postural exercises, auditory nerve training, optometric training to remedy visual-perceptual and sensorimotor coordination processes) are unproved.
These disorders impair development of personal, social, academic, and / or occupational functioning and typically involve difficulties with the acquisition, retention, or application of specific skills or sets of information.
The disorders may involve dysfunction in attention, memory, perception, language, problem-solving, or social interaction.
Other common neurodevelopmental disorders include attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability.

© Springer Science+Business Media Contact Dermatitis (Allergic) Skin manifestations of allergic contact dermatitis range from erythema through vesiculation to edema with bullae.
Changes often occur in a pattern or distribution that suggests a specific exposure.
In this image, linear streaking on an extremity suggests plant contact (eg, poison ivy or poison sumac).
Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD. Overall, the most common causes of rash in infants and young children include Diaper rash (with or without candidal infection) Seborrhea Atopic dermatitis (eczema) Viral exanthem Numerous viral infections cause rash.
Some (eg, chickenpox and measles, both of which are currently uncommon because of vaccination but should be considered in unvaccinated children; erythema infectiosum) have a fairly typical appearance and clinical manifestation; others are nonspecific.
Cutaneous drug reactions are usually self-limited maculopapular exanthems, but sometimes more serious reactions occur.
Uncommon but serious causes of rash include Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Meningococcemia Kawasaki disease Stevens-Johnson syndrome Table Evaluation of Rash in Infants and Young Children History History of present illness focuses on the time course of illness, particularly the relationship between the rash and other symptoms.
Review of systems focuses on symptoms of causative disorders, including gastrointestinal symptoms (suggesting immunoglobulin A-associated vasculitis [formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura] or hemolytic-uremic syndrome), joint symptoms (suggesting immunoglobulin A-associated vasculitis or Lyme disease), headache or neurologic symptoms (suggesting meningitis or Lyme disease).
Past medical history should note any drugs recently used, particularly antibiotics and anticonvulsants.
Most rashes are not serious.
Family history of atopy is noted.
Physical examination Examination begins with a review of vital signs, particularly to check for fever.
Initial observation assesses the infant or child for signs of lethargy, irritability, or distress.
A full physical examination is done, with particular attention to the characteristics of the skin lesions, including the presence of blistering, vesicles, petechiae, purpura, or urticaria and mucosal involvement.
Children are evaluated for meningeal signs (neck stiffness, Kernig and Brudzinski signs), although these signs are often absent in children < 2 years.
Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Blistering or skin sloughing Diarrhea and / or abdominal pain Fever and inconsolability or extreme irritability Mucosal inflammation Petechiae and / or purpura Urticaria with respiratory distress Interpretation of findings Well-appearing children without systemic symptoms or signs are unlikely to have a dangerous disorder.
The appearance of the rash typically narrows the differential diagnosis.
The associated symptoms and signs help identify patients with a serious disorder and often suggest the diagnosis (see Table: Some Causes of Rash in Infants and Children).
Bullae and / or sloughing suggest staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or Stevens-Johnson syndrome and are considered dermatologic emergencies.
Conjunctival inflammation may occur in Kawasaki disease, measles, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Etiology of Rash in Infants and Young Children Rashes can be caused by infection (viral, fungal, or bacterial), contact with irritants, atopy, drug hypersensitivity, other allergic reactions, inflammatory conditions, or vasculitides (see Table: Some Causes of Rash in Infants and Children).
Any child presenting with fever and petechiae or purpura must be evaluated carefully for the possibility of meningococcemia.
Bloody diarrhea with pallor and petechiae should raise concern about the possibility of hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Fever for > 5 days with evidence of mucosal inflammation and rash should prompt consideration of and further evaluation for Kawasaki disease.
Testing For most children, the history and physical examination are sufficient for diagnosis.
Testing is targeted at potential life threats; it includes Gram stain and cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid for meningococcemia; complete blood count, renal function tests, and stool tests for hemolytic uremic syndrome).
Treatment of Rash in Infants and Young Children Treatment of rash is directed at the cause (eg, antifungal cream for candidal infection).
For diaper rash, the goal is to keep the diaper area clean and dry, primarily by changing diapers more frequently and gently washing the area with mild soap and water.
Sometimes a barrier ointment containing zinc oxide or vitamins A and D may help.
Pruritus in infants and children can be lessened by oral antihistamines: Diphenhydramine: For children > 6 months, 1.25 mg / kg every 6 hours (maximum 50 mg every 6 hours) Hydroxyzine: For children > 6 months, 0.5 mg / kg every 6 hours (maximum for children < 6 years, 12.5 mg every 6 hours; for those ≥ 6 years, 25 mg every 6 hours) Cetirizine: For children 6 to 23 months, 2.5 mg once a day; for those 2 to 5 years, 2.5 to 5 mg once a day; for those > 6 years, 5 to 10 mg once a day Loratadine: For children 2 to 5 years, 5 mg once a day; for those > 6 years, 10 mg once a day Some common adverse effects of antihistamines include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, restlessness or moodiness (in some children), urinary hesitancy, blurred vision, and confusion.
Key Points Most rashes in children are benign.
Examples of Rashes in Children Molluscum Contagiosum on a Child's Face The photo shows lesions of molluscum contagiosum.
For most rashes in infants and children, the history and physical examination are sufficient for diagnosis.
Children with rash due to serious illness typically have systemic manifestations of disease.
Lesions are typically 1 to 5 mm, solitary or grouped, firm, painless papules.
They are pearly to pink in color, dome shaped, and may be umbilicated.

Cough in Children By Deborah M Consolini, MD, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Reviewed / Revised Nov 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Evaluation Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Some Causes of Cough in Children Cough is a reflex that helps clear the airways of secretions, protects the airway from foreign body aspiration, and can be the manifesting symptom of a disease.
Review of systems should note symptoms of possible causes, including abdominal pain (some bacterial pneumonias), weight loss or poor weight gain and foul-smelling stools (cystic fibrosis), and muscle soreness (possible association with viral illness or atypical pneumonia but usually not with bacterial pneumonia).
Past medical history should cover recent respiratory infections, repeated pneumonias, history of known allergies or asthma, risk factors for TB (eg, exposure to a person who has known or suspected TB infection, exposure to prisons, HIV infection, travel to or immigration from countries that have endemic infection), and exposure to respiratory irritants.
Physical examination Vital signs, including respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation, should be noted.
Signs of respiratory distress (eg, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, cyanosis, grunting, stridor, marked anxiety) should be noted.
Head and neck examination should focus on presence and amount of nasal discharge and the condition of the nasal turbinates (pale, boggy, or inflamed).
The pharynx should be checked for postnasal drip.
The cervical and supraclavicular areas should be inspected and palpated for lymphadenopathy.
Lung examination focuses on presence of stridor, wheezing, crackles, rhonchi, decreased breath sounds, and signs of consolidation (eg, egophony, E to A change, dullness to percussion).
Abdominal examination should focus on presence of abdominal pain, especially in the upper quadrants (indicating possible left or right lower lobe pneumonia).
Examination of extremities should note clubbing or cyanosis of nail beds (cystic fibrosis).
Cough is one of the most common complaints for which parents bring their children to a health care practitioner.
Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Cyanosis or hypoxia on pulse oximetry Stridor Respiratory distress Toxic appearance Abnormal lung examination Interpretation of findings Clinical findings frequently indicate a specific cause (see Table: Some Causes of Cough in Children); the distinction between acute and chronic cough is particularly helpful, although it is important to note that many disorders that cause chronic cough begin acutely and patients may present before 4 weeks have passed.
Other characteristics of the cough are helpful but less specific.
A barky cough suggests croup or tracheitis; it can also be characteristic of psychogenic cough or a postrespiratory tract infection cough.
A staccato cough is consistent with a viral or atypical pneumonia.
A paroxysmal cough is characteristic of pertussis or certain viral pneumonias (adenovirus).
Failure to thrive or weight loss can occur with TB or cystic fibrosis.
Nighttime cough can indicate postnasal drip or asthma.
Coughing at the beginning of sleep and in the morning with waking usually indicates sinusitis; coughing in the middle of the night is more consistent with asthma.
In young children with sudden cough and no fever or URI symptoms, the examiner should have a high index of suspicion for foreign body aspiration.
Testing Children with red flag findings should have pulse oximetry and chest x-ray.
Etiology of Cough in Children Causes of cough differ depending on whether the symptoms are acute (< 4 weeks) or chronic (> 4 weeks).
Children with stridor, drooling, fever, and marked anxiety need to be evaluated for epiglottitis typically in an operating room by an ear, nose, and throat specialist prepared to immediately place an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.
If foreign body aspiration is suspected, chest x-ray with inspiratory and expiratory views should be done (or in some centers a chest CT).
Children with TB risk factors or weight loss should have a chest x-ray and purified protein derivative (PPD) testing or an interferon-gamma release assay.
Children with repeated episodes of pneumonia, poor growth, or foul-smelling stools should have a chest x-ray and sweat testing for cystic fibrosis.
Acute cough in children with upper respiratory infection symptoms and no red flag findings is usually caused by a viral infection.
Testing is rarely indicated unless it is necessary for infection control (eg, a COVID-19 outbreak in a school or day care center).
Many other children without red flag findings have a presumptive diagnosis after the history and physical examination.
Testing is not necessary in such cases; however, if empiric treatment has been instituted and has not been successful, testing may be necessary.
For example, if allergic sinusitis is suspected and treated with an antihistamine that does not alleviate symptoms, a head CT may be necessary for further evaluation.
Suspected gastroesophageal reflux disorder unsuccessfully treated with an H2 blocker and / or proton pump inhibitor may require evaluation with a pH or impedance probe study or endoscopy.
Treatment of Cough in Children Treatment of cough is management of the underlying disorder.
For example, antibiotics should be given for bacterial pneumonia; bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs should be given for asthma.
Children with viral infections should receive supportive care, including oxygen and / or bronchodilators as needed.
Little evidence exists to support the use of cough suppressants and mucolytic agents.
Coughing is an important mechanism for clearing secretions from the airways and can assist in recovery from respiratory infections.
Use of nonspecific drugs for cough suppression is discouraged in children.
Key Points Clinical diagnosis is often adequate.
A high index of suspicion for foreign body aspiration is needed if children are 6 months to 6 years of age.
Antitussives and expectorants lack proof of effect in most cases.
The most common cause of acute cough is Viral upper respiratory infection The most common causes of chronic cough are Asthma (most common) Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) Postnasal drip Foreign body aspiration and diseases such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia are less common, but they can all result in persistent cough.
Obtain a chest x-ray if patients have red flag findings or chronic cough.
Table Evaluation of Cough in Children History History of present illness should cover duration and quality of cough (barky, staccato, paroxysmal) and onset (sudden or indolent).
The physician should ask about associated symptoms.
Some of these symptoms are ubiquitous (eg, runny nose, sore throat, fever); others may suggest a specific cause: headache, itchy eyes, and sore throat (postnasal drip); wheezing and cough with exertion (asthma); night sweats (tuberculosis [TB]); and, in infants, spitting up, irritability, or arching of the back after feedings (gastroesophageal reflux).
For children 6 months to 6 years, the parents should be asked about potential for foreign body aspiration, including older siblings or visitors with small toys, access to small objects, and consumption of small, smooth foods (eg, peanuts, grapes).
Necrotizing Enterocolitis By William J Cochran, MD, Geisinger Clinic Reviewed / Revised Aug 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Key Points Topic Resources Radiologic Features of Necrotizin... Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acquired disease, primarily of preterm or sick neonates, characterized by mucosal or even deeper intestinal necrosis.
It is believed that an ischemic insult damages the intestinal lining, leading to increased intestinal permeability and leaving the intestine susceptible to bacterial invasion.
NEC rarely occurs before enteral feedings have begun and is less common among breastfed infants.
However, once feedings are begun, ample substrate is present for proliferation of luminal bacteria, which can penetrate the damaged intestinal wall, producing hydrogen gas.
The gas may collect within the intestinal wall (pneumatosis intestinalis) or enter the portal veins.
Dysbiosis (alteration of the intestinal microbiome), such as that which occurs after treatment with antibiotics or acid-suppressing drugs, may also be a contributing factor because it increases potentially pathogenic bacteria.
The initial ischemic insult may result from vasospasm of the mesenteric arteries, which can be caused by an anoxic insult triggering the primitive diving reflex that markedly diminishes intestinal blood flow.
Intestinal ischemia may also result from low blood flow during an exchange transfusion, during sepsis, or from the use of hyperosmolar formulas.
Similarly, congenital heart disease with reduced systemic blood flow or arterial oxygen desaturation may lead to intestinal hypoxia / ischemia and predispose to NEC.
NEC may occur as clusters of cases or as outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units.
Some clusters appear to be associated with specific organisms (eg, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Clostridioides difficile), but often no specific pathogen is identified.
It is the most common gastrointestinal emergency among neonates.
Complications of necrotizing enterocolitis Necrosis begins in the mucosa and may progress to involve the full thickness of the intestinal wall, causing intestinal perforation with subsequent peritonitis and often free intra-abdominal air.
Perforation occurs most commonly in the terminal ileum; the colon and the proximal small bowel are involved less frequently.
Sepsis occurs in 20 to 30% of infants with NEC, and death may occur in 20% of infants with NEC.
Symptoms and Signs of NEC Infants may present with feeding difficulties and bloody or bilious gastric residuals (after feedings) that may progress to bilious emesis, ileus manifested by abdominal distention, or gross blood in stool.
Sepsis may be manifested by lethargy, temperature instability, increased apneic spells, and metabolic acidosis.
Diagnosis of NEC Detection of blood in stool Abdominal x-rays Ultrasonography Early x-rays may be nonspecific and reveal only ileus.
However, a fixed, dilated intestinal loop (sentinel loop) that does not change on repeated x-rays is very concerning for NEC.
X-ray signs diagnostic of NEC are pneumatosis intestinalis and portal vein gas.
Pneumoperitoneum indicates bowel perforation and an urgent need for surgery.
Ultrasonography is being used increasingly in cases of NEC.
Symptoms and signs include feeding intolerance, lethargy, temperature instability, ileus, bloating, bilious emesis, hematochezia, reducing substances in the stool, apnea, and sometimes signs of sepsis.
With ultrasonography, clinicians have the ability to look at bowel wall thickness, pneumatosis intestinalis, and blood flow.
This technique, however, is very operator dependent, and plain x-rays are still more commonly used.
Treatment of NEC Feedings stopped Nasogastric suction Fluid resuscitation Broad-spectrum antibiotics Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) Sometimes surgery or percutaneous drainage The mortality rate is 20 to 30%.
Aggressive support and judicious timing of surgical intervention maximize the chance of survival.
Support Nonsurgical support is sufficient in over 75% of cases.
Feedings must be stopped immediately if NEC is suspected, and the intestine should be decompressed with a double-lumen nasogastric tube attached to intermittent suction.
Appropriate colloid and crystalloid parenteral fluids must be given to support circulation, because extensive intestinal inflammation and peritonitis may lead to considerable 3rd-space fluid loss.
TPN is needed for 10 to 14 days while the intestine heals.
Systemic antibiotics should be started at once with a beta-lactam antibiotic (eg, ampicillin) and an aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin, amikacin).
Additional anaerobic coverage (eg, clindamycin, metronidazole) may also be considered.
Diagnosis is clinical and is confirmed by imaging studies.
Antibiotics should be continued for 10 to 14 days (for dosage, see Table: Recommended Dosages of Selected Parenteral Antibiotics for Neonates).
Because some outbreaks may be infectious, patient isolation should be considered, particularly if several cases occur within a short time.
The infant requires close monitoring; frequent complete reevaluation (eg, at least every 12 hours); and serial abdominal x-rays, complete blood counts (CBCs), platelet counts, and blood gases.
Intestinal strictures are the most common long-term complication of NEC, occurring in 10 to 36% of infants who survive the initial event.
Strictures typically manifest within 2 to 3 months of an NEC episode.
Strictures are most commonly noted in the colon, especially on the left side.
Short bowel syndrome develops in about 10% of infants with NEC.
Surgery Surgical intervention is needed in < 25% of infants.
Absolute indications are intestinal perforation (pneumoperitoneum), signs of peritonitis (absent intestinal sounds and diffuse guarding and tenderness or erythema and edema of the abdominal wall), or aspiration of purulent material from the peritoneal cavity by paracentesis.
Treatment is primarily supportive and includes nasogastric suction, parenteral fluids, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, isolation in cases of infection, and, sometimes, surgery.
Surgery should be considered for an infant with NEC whose clinical and laboratory conditions worsen despite nonsurgical support.
Primary percutaneous peritoneal drainage is an option and can be done at the bedside.
In this procedure, the surgeon makes an incision in the right lower quadrant through which the abdomen is irrigated with warm saline solution.
A drain is then placed to allow continued drainage of the abdomen.
When drainage has stopped, the drain can be pulled back a little each day and subsequently removed.
This procedure is done more commonly in very sick, extremely low-birth-weight infants who would be at risk if taken to an operating room; however, it may be associated with a higher mortality.
For infants undergoing laparotomy, the gangrenous bowel is resected, and ostomies are created.
(Primary reanastomosis may be done if the remaining intestine shows no signs of ischemia.)
With resolution of sepsis and peritonitis, intestinal continuity can be reestablished several weeks or months later.
Prevention of NEC At-risk infants should ideally be fed breast milk, and feedings should begin with small amounts that are gradually increased according to standardized protocols.
Over 90% of cases of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) occur in premature infants.
(Preterm formula is an appropriate substitute if breast milk is not available.)
Hypertonic formula, drugs, or contrast material should be avoided.
Anemia, low oxygen saturations, and polycythemia should be treated promptly.
When possible, antibiotics and acid-supressing drugs should be avoided.
Probiotics (eg, Bifidus infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus) help prevent NEC, but further studies to determine optimal dosing and appropriate strains are required before routine use (1).
Neonatology 13: 1 - 11, 2019. doi: 10.1159/000504371 Key Points Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is intestinal necrosis of uncertain etiology; it occurs mainly in preterm or sick neonates after enteral feedings have begun.
It occurs in about 1 to 8% of neonatal intensive care unit admissions.
Complications include intestinal perforation (most often in the terminal ileum) and peritonitis; sepsis occurs in 20 to 30%, and death may occur in 20%.
Initial manifestations are feeding difficulties and bloody or bilious gastric residuals (after feedings) followed by bilious emesis, abdominal distention, and / or gross blood in stool.
Diagnose using plain x-rays.
Supportive treatment using fluid resuscitation, nasogastric suction, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition is effective in > 75% of cases.
Surgery to resect gangrenous bowel and treat perforation is needed in < 25% of infants.
Risk factors General risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in addition to prematurity include Prolonged rupture of the membranes with amnionitis Birth asphyxia Small-for-gestational-age infants Congenital heart disease Anemia Exchange transfusions Alteration of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) Non-human milk feeding Three intestinal factors are usually present: A preceding ischemic insult Bacterial colonization Intraluminal substrate (ie, enteral feedings) Etiology of NEC The exact etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis is not clear.
However, the increased permeability and immature immune function of the immature intestinal tract are predisposing factors.
Kernicterus (Bilirubin Encephalopathy) By Kevin C Dysart, MD, Nemours / Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children Reviewed / Revised Mar 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Kernicterus is brain damage caused by unconjugated bilirubin deposition in basal ganglia and brain stem nuclei.
A definite diagnosis of kernicterus can be made only by autopsy.
Treatment of Kernicterus Prevention of hyperbilirubinemia There is no treatment once kernicterus develops; it must be prevented by treating hyperbilirubinemia.
Normally, bilirubin bound to serum albumin stays in the intravascular space.
However, bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause kernicterus when serum bilirubin concentration is markedly elevated (hyperbilirubinemia), serum albumin concentration is markedly low (eg, in preterm infants), or bilirubin is displaced from albumin by competitive binders (eg, sulfisoxazole, ceftriaxone, and aspirin; free fatty acids and hydrogen ions in fasting, septic, or acidotic infants).
Symptoms and Signs of Kernicterus In preterm infants, kernicterus may not cause recognizable clinical symptoms or signs.
Early symptoms of kernicterus in term infants are lethargy, poor feeding, and vomiting.
Opisthotonos, oculogyric crisis, seizures, and death may follow.
Kernicterus may result in intellectual disability, choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, and paralysis of upward gaze later in childhood.
It is unknown whether minor degrees of kernicterus can cause less severe neurologic impairment (eg, perceptual-motor problems, learning disorders).
Diagnosis of Kernicterus Clinical evaluation There is no reliable test to determine the presence of kernicterus, and the diagnosis is made presumptively.
Agoraphobia in Children and Adolescents By Josephine Elia, MD, Nemours / A I.
Agoraphobia must be distinguished from the following: Specific phobias (eg, to a certain situation) Social anxiety disorder Panic disorder Depression, which can cause patients to avoid leaving the house for reasons unrelated to anxiety Treatment Behavioral therapy Behavioral therapy is especially useful for agoraphobia symptoms.
Medications are rarely useful except to control any associated panic attacks.
duPont Hospital for Children Reviewed / Revised May 2023 View Patient Education Diagnosis Treatment Agoraphobia is a persistent fear of being trapped in situations or places without a way to escape easily and without help.
(See also Agoraphobia in adults.)
Agoraphobia is uncommon among children, but it may develop in adolescents, particularly those who also have panic attacks.
Diagnosis Psychiatric assessment Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) criteria For agoraphobia to be diagnosed, patients must consistently have unreasonable fear or anxiety about ≥ 2 of the following for ≥ 6 months: Using public transportation Being in open spaces Being in enclosed spaces Standing in line or being in a crowd Being outside the home alone Also, the fear must cause patients to avoid the distressing situation to the extent that they have difficulty functioning normally (eg, going to school, visiting the mall, doing other typical activities).
Cystinuria By Christopher J LaRosa, MD, Perelman School of Medicine at The University of Pennsylvania Reviewed / Revised Dec 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Cystinuria is an inherited defect of the renal tubules in which reabsorption of cystine (the homodimer of the amino acid cysteine) is impaired, urinary excretion is increased, and cystine stones form in the urinary tract.
Pathophysiology of Cystinuria The primary defect results in diminished renal proximal tubular reabsorption of cystine and increased urinary cystine concentration.
Cystine is poorly soluble in acidic urine, so when its urinary concentration exceeds its solubility, crystals precipitate and cystine kidney stones form.
Resorption of other dibasic amino acids (lysine, ornithine, arginine) is also impaired but causes no problems because these amino acids have an alternative transport system separate from that shared with cystine.
Furthermore, they are more soluble than cystine in urine, and their increased excretion does not result in crystal or stone formation.
Their absorption (and that of cystine) is also decreased in the small bowel.
Symptoms and Signs of Cystinuria Symptoms of cystinuria, most commonly renal colic, may occur in infants but usually appear between ages 10 and 30.
Urinary tract infection and chronic kidney disease due to urinary tract obstruction may develop.
Diagnosis of Cystinuria Analysis of collected kidney stones Microscopic examination of urinary sediment Measurement of urinary cystine excretion Radiopaque cystine stones form in the renal pelvis or bladder.
Staghorn stones are common.
Symptoms are colic caused by stones and perhaps urinary infection or the sequela of chronic kidney disease.
Cystine may appear in the urine as yellow-brown hexagonal crystals, which are diagnostic.
Excessive cystine in the urine may be detected with the nitroprusside cyanide test.
Quantitative cystine excretion is typically > 400 mg / day in cystinuria (normal is < 30 mg / day).
Treatment of Cystinuria High fluid intake Alkalinization of the urine Dietary sodium restriction Dietary animal protein restriction (when possible) End-stage renal disease may develop.
Decreasing urinary cystine concentration below about 250 to 300 mg / L (1 to 1.25 mmol / L) decreases renal toxicity and can allow clearance of cystine in solution.
This decrease is accomplished by increasing urine volume with fluid intake sufficient to provide a urine flow rate of 1.5 to 2 L / m2 / day, which could require fluid intake as high as 2 to 4 L / day (1).
Hydration is particularly important at night when urinary volume and pH drop.
Alkalinization of the urine to pH > 7.0 with potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate 1 mEq / kg orally 3 to 4 times a day and in some cases acetazolamide 5 mg / kg (up to 250 mg) orally at bedtime increases the solubility of cystine significantly.
Mild restrictions of dietary sodium (100 mEq / day) and animal protein (0.8 to 1.0 g / kg / day) may help reduce cystine excretion.
When high fluid intake and alkalinization do not reduce stone formation, other oral drugs may be tried.
Diagnosis is by measurement of cystine excretion in the urine.
Penicillamine (7.5 mg / kg 4 times a day in young children and 125 mg to 0.5 g 4 times a day in older children) improves cystine solubility, but toxicity limits its usefulness.
About half of all patients develop some toxic manifestation, such as fever, rash, arthralgias, or, less commonly, nephrotic syndrome, pancytopenia, or a lupus-like reaction.
Pyridoxine supplements (50 mg once / day) should be given with penicillamine.
Tiopronin (100 to 300 mg 4 times a day) can be used instead of penicillamine to treat some children because it has a lower frequency of adverse effects.
Captopril (0.3 mg / kg 3 times a day) is not as effective as penicillamine but is less toxic.
Close monitoring of response to therapy is very important.
Animal models (eg, gene knockout mice) are currently being used toward the development of novel therapies for cystinosis (2).
Treatment is with increased fluid intake and alkalinization of the urine.
Urolithiasis 47 (1): 57 - 66, 2019. doi: 10.1007 / s00240 - 018 - 1101 - 7 Key Points Defective urinary resorption of cystine increases urinary cystine levels, leading to cystine kidney stones and sometimes chronic kidney disease.
Yellow-brown hexagonal crystals in the urine are pathognomonic; quantitative cystine excretion is typically > 400 mg / day.
Treat with increased fluid intake to give urine output of 1.5 to 2 L / m2 / day, and alkalinize urine with potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate.
Restrict dietary sodium and animal protein.
Drugs such as penicillamine, tiopronin, or captopril may be necessary, but adverse effects are a concern.
Cystinuria was originally classified according to urinary excretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids in obligate carriers.
In this classification, parents of affected children were assessed as having either normal (type I), moderate (type III), or significant (type II) increases in cystine excretion.
A newer classification is based on genotype: Type A patients have homozygous mutations in the gene SLC3A1 and type B patients have homozygous mutations in SLC7A9.
These genes encode proteins that together form a heterodimer responsible for cystine and dibasic amino acid transport in the proximal tubule.
Cystinuria should not be confused with cystinosis (see Hereditary Fanconi syndrome).
Multiple Mononeuropathy (Mononeuritis Multiplex) By Michael Rubin, MDCM, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Reviewed / Revised Apr 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Multiple mononeuropathies are characterized by sensory disturbances and weakness in the distribution of ≥ 2 affected peripheral nerves.
Underlying disorders are treated.
Multiple mononeuropathy is usually secondary to Connective tissue disorders (eg, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], other types of vasculitis, Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) Sarcoidosis Metabolic disorders (eg, diabetes, amyloidosis) Infectious disorders (eg, Lyme disease, HIV infection, leprosy) However, diabetes usually causes sensorimotor distal polyneuropathy.
Multiple mononeuropathies are characterized by pain, weakness, and paresthesias in the distribution of the affected nerves.
Multiple mononeuropathy is often asymmetric at first; nerves may be involved all at once or progressively.
Extensive involvement of many nerves may simulate polyneuropathy.
Symptoms and examination findings may be nearly pathognomonic for multiple mononeuropathy.
When they are not, electrodiagnostic testing is done to establish the diagnosis, localize the lesion, assess severity, and estimate prognosis.
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Caused by 11Beta-Hydroxylase Deficiency By Andrew Calabria, MD, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Reviewed / Revised Aug 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Adrenal hormone synthesis 11Beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) deficiency involves defective production of cortisol, with accumulation of mineralocorticoid precursors, resulting in hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypertension and increased production of adrenal androgens, leading to virilization.
Lancet 390 (10108): 2194 - 2210, 2017. doi: 10.1016/S0140 - 6736 (17) 31431 - 9 Symptoms and Signs Female neonates may present with genital ambiguity, including clitoral enlargement, labial fusion, and a urogenital sinus.
Male neonates usually appear normal, but some present with penile enlargement.
Some children present later, with precocious puberty or, in females, menstrual irregularities and hirsutism.
Salt retention with hypernatremia, hypertension, and hypokalemic alkalosis may result from increased mineralocorticoid activity due to increased deoxycorticosterone levels.
Diagnosis Plasma levels of 11-deoxycortisol and adrenal androgens Prenatal diagnosis is not available.
Diagnosis of 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency in neonates is established by increased plasma levels of 11-deoxycortisol and adrenal androgens (DHEA, androstenedione, and testosterone).
Plasma renin activity is often suppressed because of increased mineralocorticoid activity; this test may be useful in older children but is less reliable in neonates.
If the diagnosis is uncertain, levels of 11-deoxycortisol and adrenal androgens are measured before and 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation.
In affected adolescents, basal plasma levels may be normal, so ACTH stimulation is recommended.
Diagnosis is by measurement of cortisol, its precursors, and adrenal androgens and sometimes by measuring 11-deoxycortisol after adrenocorticotropic hormone administration.
Hypertension occurs in about two thirds of patients with CYP11B1 deficiency and distinguishes it from CYP21A2 deficiency, which causes hypotension.
Because both CYP11B1 deficiency and CYP21A2 deficiency can cause increased levels of 17 - hydroxyprogesterone, which is measured during routine newborn screening, patients with mild to moderately increased levels of 17 - hydroxyprogesterone should have 11-deoxycortisol levels measured.
Hypokalemia may occur but not in all patients.
Pearls & Pitfalls 11Beta-hydroxylase deficiency causes hypertension and sometimes hypokalemia, in contrast to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which causes hypotension and hyperkalemia.
Treatment Corticosteroid replacement Sometimes antihypertensive therapy Sometimes reconstructive surgery Treatment of 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency is cortisol replacement, typically with hydrocortisone 3.5 to 5 mg / m 2 orally 3 times a day, with total daily dose typically ≤ 20 mg / m 2, which prevents further virilization and ameliorates hypertension by reducing levels of 11-deoxycortisol, deoxycorticosterone, and adrenal androgens that are stimulated by ACTH.
Unlike CYP21A2 deficiency, mineralocorticoid replacement is not required, because sodium and potassium homeostasis is maintained from mineralocorticoid effects of deoxycorticosterone.
Response to treatment should be monitored, typically by measuring serum 11-deoxycortisol and adrenal androgens and by assessing growth velocity and skeletal maturation.
Blood pressure should be monitored closely in patients who presented with hypertension.
Antihypertensives, such as potassium-sparing diuretics or calcium channel blockers, may be required.
Affected female infants may require surgical reconstruction with reduction clitoroplasty and construction of a vaginal opening.
Often, further surgery is required in adulthood, but with appropriate care and attention to psychosexual issues, normal sexual function and fertility may be expected.
Key Points Children with 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency have excess mineralocorticoid activity and increased adrenal androgens, which cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and virilization.
In females, androgen excess usually manifests at birth with ambiguous external genitals (eg, clitoral enlargement, fusion of the labia majora, a urogenital sinus rather than distinct urethral and vaginal openings); later in life they may have hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, and acne.
Male infants usually appear normal but may later have precocious puberty.
Diagnose by steroid hormone levels and sometimes adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation.
Treat with corticosteroid replacement and sometimes antihypertensives; females may require reconstructive surgery.
11Beta-hydroxylase deficiency causes about 5 to 8% of all cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Some states also include testing for cystic fibrosis, disorders of fatty acid oxidation, other organic acidemias, and severe combined immunodeficiency.
HIV screening is required by some states and is indicated for children of mothers known to be HIV-positive or those engaging in HIV high-risk behaviors.
Toxicology screening is indicated when any of the following are present: maternal history of drug use, unexplained placental abruption, unexplained premature labor, poor prenatal care, or evidence of drug withdrawal in the neonate.
Screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) using pulse oximetry is part of routine newborn assessment.
Previously, newborns were screened for CCHD by prenatal ultrasonography and by physical examination, but this approach failed to identify many cases of CCHD, which led to increased morbidity and mortality.
The screening is done when infants are ≥ 24 hours old and is considered positive if Any oxygen saturation measurement is < 90%.
The oxygen saturation measurements in both the right hand and foot are < 95% on 3 separate measurements taken 1 hour apart.
There is > 3% absolute difference between the oxygen saturation in the right hand (preductal) and foot (postductal) on 3 separate measurements taken 1 hour apart.
Any infant with a positive screen should have additional testing, including chest x-ray, electrocardiography, and echocardiography.
The infant's pediatrician should be notified, and the infant may need to be evaluated by a cardiologist.
Hearing screening varies by state.
Hearing loss is one of the most frequently occurring birth defects.
About 3/1000 infants are born with moderate, profound, or severe hearing loss.
Hearing loss is even more common among infants admitted to an intensive care unit at birth.
Currently, some states screen only high-risk neonates (see Table: High-Risk Factors for Hearing Deficits in Neonates); others screen all neonates.
Initial screening often involves using a handheld device to test for echoes produced by healthy ears in response to soft clicks (otoacoustic emissions); if this test is abnormal, auditory brain stem response (ABR) testing is done.
Some institutions use ABR testing as an initial screening test.
Further testing by an audiologist may be needed.
Table High-Risk Factors for Hearing Deficits in Neonates Factor Specifics Birth weight < 1500 g Apgar score ≤ 7 at 5 minutes Serum bilirubin > 22 mg / dL (> 376 micromol / L) in neonate whose birth weight is > 2000 g > 17 mg / dL (> 290 micromol / L) in neonate whose birth weight is < 2000 g Disorders Perinatal anoxia or hypoxia Neonatal sepsis or meningitis Craniofacial abnormalities Seizures or apneic spells Congenital infections Rubella Syphilis Herpes simplex infection Cytomegalovirus infection Toxoplasmosis Maternal exposure Aminoglycosides Family history Early hearing loss in a parent or close relative
Blood typing is indicated when the mother has type O or Rh-negative blood or when minor blood antigens are present because hemolytic disease of the newborn is a risk.
All neonates are evaluated for jaundice throughout the hospital stay and before discharge.
The risk of hyperbilirubinemia is assessed using risk criteria, measurement of bilirubin, or both.
Bilirubin can be measured transcutaneously or in serum.
Many hospitals screen all neonates and use a predictive nomogram to determine the risk of extreme hyperbilirubinemia.
Follow-up is based on age at discharge, predischarge bilirubin level and / or rate of bilirubin rise from one determination to another, and risk of developing jaundice.
Most states test for specific inherited diseases, including phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, biotinidase deficiency, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease, galactosemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, sickle cell disease, and hypothyroidism.
Classes of oral drugs used to treat hypertension include Adrenergic modifiers (beta - and alpha-antagonist, alpha-2-agonist, beta-blocker) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Angiotensin IIreceptor blockers (ARBs) Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) Thiazide diuretics Vasodilators Oral therapy for persistent hypertension in children should generally begin with an ACE inhibitor or a CCB.
(ARBs are equally effective and do not cause a cough, but there are more data in children on the use of ACE inhibitors.)
Both classes of drugs can be given as a single daily dose and seem to be equally effective.
ACE inhibitors should be used in patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes because these drugs may also protect the kidneys.
CCBs should be used in menstruating girls if there is risk of pregnancy because ACE inhibitors and ARBs have significant effects on a fetus.
CCBs also have no significant effect on blood chemistries.
Thiazide diuretics have been used as initial treatment, but salt intake in adolescents is usually so high that they are rarely effective.
If initial therapy with a single drug does not achieve the target BP, a second drug should be added.
If the first drug is an ACE inhibitor or ARB, thiazide diuretics have proved to work well as second drugs, but a CCB could be added instead.
If the first drug is a CCB, then an ACE inhibitor or an ARB usually works as a second drug, but if there is a risk of pregnancy, they need to be avoided, and a thiazide diuretic or other drug can be tried instead.
If a thiazide diuretic is used, chlorthalidone is the ideal one to use because it can be given once a day.
Except in special conditions, vasodilators and alpha - and beta-blockers are 3rd-line drugs, which if needed should be used after consultation with a specialist.
Pediatrics 140 (3): e20171904, 2017. doi: 10.1542 / peds.2017 - 1904 Adrenergic Modifiers Adrenergic modifiers include central alpha-2-agonists, postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers, and peripheral-acting nonselective adrenergic blockers (see table Oral Adrenergic Agents for Hypertension in Children).
Alpha-2-agonists (eg, clonidine) stimulate alpha-2-adrenergic receptors in the brain stem and reduce sympathetic nervous activity, lowering BP.
Because they have a central action, they are more likely than other antihypertensives to cause drowsiness, lethargy, and depression; they are no longer widely used.
Clonidine can be applied transdermally once a week as a patch; thus, it may be useful for nonadherent patients.
Postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers (eg, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin) are no longer used for primary treatment of hypertension because evidence suggests no reduction in mortality.
Table Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors ACE inhibitors (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors for Hypertension in Children) reduce BP by interfering with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and by inhibiting the degradation of bradykinin, thereby decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without causing reflex tachycardia.
These drugs reduce BP in many hypertensive patients, regardless of plasma renin activity.
Because these drugs provide renal protection, they are the drugs of choice for patients with diabetes and for hypertensive children with many types of kidney disorders.
A dry, irritating cough is the most common adverse effect (much less common in children than in older patients), but angioedema is the most serious and, if it affects the oropharynx, can be fatal.
Angioedema is most common among blacks and smokers.
ACE inhibitors may increase serum potassium and creatinine levels, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease and those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy and should be used with caution in adolescent females who are at risk of pregnancy.
In patients with renal disorders causing renal dysfunction, serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked within 2 to 4 weeks of starting therapy.
If the levels are increased, then they should be monitored at least every 3 to 6 months (more frequently if the increases are significant).
ACE inhibitors can cause acute kidney injury in patients who have hypovolemia, severe heart failure, severe bilateral renal artery stenosis, or severe stenosis in the artery to a solitary kidney.
Thiazide-type diuretics enhance the antihypertensive activity of ACE inhibitors more than that of other classes of antihypertensives.
Spironolactone and eplerenone also appear to enhance the effect of ACE inhibitors.
Table Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) ARBs (see table OralAngiotensin IIReceptor Blockers (ARBs) for Hypertension in Children) block angiotensin II receptors and therefore interfere with the renin-angiotensin system as do ACE inhibitors.
ARBs and ACE inhibitors are equally effective as antihypertensives.
ARBs may provide added benefits via tissue ACE receptor blockade.
The 2 classes have the same beneficial effects in patients with left ventricular failure or with nephropathy due to diabetes and other types of kidney diseases.
An ARB should not be used together with an ACE inhibitor.
ARBs may be safely started in children and adolescents with reduced renal function, but creatinine and potassium levels need to be checked in 1 to 4 weeks If the levels are increased, then they should be monitored at least every 3 to 6 months (more frequently if the increases are significant).
Incidence of adverse events is low; angioedema occurs but much less frequently than with ACE inhibitors.
Precautions for use of ARBs in patients with renovascular hypertension, hypovolemia, and severe heart failure are the same as those for ACE inhibitors (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors for Hypertension in Children).
ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy and in adolescents who may become pregnant. Table Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) CCBs (see table Oral Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) for Hypertension in Children) are peripheral vasodilators and reduce BP by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR); they sometimes cause reflexive tachycardia, but these drugs have minimal direct effects on the heart.
Table Thiazide Diuretics In addition to other antihypertensive effects, thiazide diuretics (see table Oral Thiazide Diuretics for Hypertension in Children) cause a small amount of vasodilation as long as intravascular volume is normal.
All thiazides are equally effective in equivalent doses.
Thiazide diuretics cause potassium loss, so serum potassium should be followed until the level stabilizes.
Unless serum potassium is normalized, potassium channels in the arterial walls close and the resulting vasoconstriction makes achieving the blood pressure goal difficult.
Patients with potassium levels < 3.5 mEq / L (< 3.5 mmol / L) are given potassium supplements or are instructed about dietary changes that can increase potassium intake.
Hypokalemia is less of a problem in hypertensive children, in whom thiazides are usually combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which tend to raise potassium levels.
In most patients with diabetes, thiazide-type diuretics do not affect control of diabetes.
Uncommonly, diuretics precipitate or worsen type 2 diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome.
Table Vasodilators Direct vasodilators, including minoxidil and hydralazine (see table Oral Vasodilators for Hypertension in Children), work directly on blood vessels, independently of the autonomic nervous system.
Minoxidil is more potent than hydralazine but has more adverse effects, including sodium and water retention and hypertrichosis.
Minoxidil should be reserved for severe, refractory hypertension.
Hydralazine is used during pregnancy (eg, for preeclampsia) and as an adjunct antihypertensive.
Long-term, high-dose (> 300 mg / day) hydralazine has been associated with a drug-induced lupus syndrome, which resolves when the drug is stopped.
Generally, drug treatment should begin with a single drug at the low end of its dosing range and increased every 1 to 4 weeks until BP is controlled, the upper end of the dosing range is approached, or adverse effects develop that affect the use of the drug.
At that point, if the BP goal has not been attained, a second drug can be added and titrated as with the initial drug.
Bicuspid Aortic Valve By Lee B Beerman, MD, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Apr 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment More Information Bicuspid aortic valve is the presence of only two (rather than the normal three) valve cusps.
Circulation 119 (6): 880 - 890, 2009. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.795401 Symptoms and Signs of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Children with bicuspid aortic valve may be asymptomatic if there is little or no valve dysfunction.
Symptoms depend on the type of complication and can include fever in infective endocarditis or dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, palpitations, and exercise intolerance due to valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Examination reveals an early systolic click, a systolic ejection murmur and, if aortic regurgitation is present, a diastolic decrescendo murmur.
Diagnosis of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Physical examination Echocardiography Diagnosis is by physical examination findings and echocardiography.
Physical examination usually reveals a prominent early systolic ejection sound (click) at the apex and base of the heart.
This finding is often best heard with the patient sitting; the examiner listens at the apex for a click just after the first heart sound (S1), simulating a prominent split of S1.
Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality.
There may be a basal systolic murmur due to aortic stenosis or a high-pitched diastolic murmur if aortic regurgitation is present.
Echocardiography shows the characteristic finding of fusion of two of the three aortic valve leaflets.
Fusion of the right coronary and left coronary leaflets is the most common morphology.
Children with fusion of the right coronary and noncoronary leaflets are more likely to have progression of valve dysfunction and to require intervention during childhood.
Treatment of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Balloon dilation or surgical repair Treatment of bicuspid aortic valve is indicated if severe valve dysfunction develops and if symptoms occur.
Treatment consists of balloon dilation or surgical repair of stenotic valves.
Regurgitant valves are treated with surgery.
Ascending aorta or root replacement may be indicated if there is severe or progressive enlargement of those structures.
It is present in 0.5 to 2% of live births (1).
Patients with bicuspid aortic valve are predisposed to developing infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, and / or aortic stenosis.
Bicuspid aortic valve can also be associated with dilation of the aortic root or ascending aorta and with coarctation of the aorta.
There is a genetic predilection for bicuspid aortic valves, with a 9% reported family prevalence, so first-degree relatives of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve should undergo screening echocardiography.
Recognition of a bicuspid valve, even in a patient who has normal valve function, is important for purposes of follow-up because of the association of bicuspid valves with an aortopathy that results in progressive aortic root or ascending aortic dilation and aneurysm formation.
Renal Glucosuria (Renal Glycosuria) By L Aimee Hechanova, MD, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso Reviewed / Revised May 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Renal glucosuria is glucose in the urine without hyperglycemia; it results from either an acquired or an inherited, isolated defect in glucose transport or occurs with other renal tubule disorders.
With such findings, transport defects other than glucosuria should be sought.
Diagnosis of Renal Glucosuria Urinalysis The disorder is typically initially noted on routine urinalysis, and is defined as glucosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia (serum glucose < 140 mg / dL).
Some experts require a normal result on an oral glucose tolerance test for the diagnosis.
Treatment of Renal Glucosuria No treatment needed Isolated renal glucosuria is benign; no treatment is necessary.
Renal glucosuria is the excretion of glucose in the urine in the presence of normal plasma glucose levels.
Renal glucosuria can be inherited.
This form usually involves a reduction in the glucose transport maximum (the maximum rate at which glucose can be resorbed) and subsequent escape of glucose in the urine.
The inherited disorder is usually transmitted as an incompletely recessive trait (heterozygotes have modest glucosuria).
Renal glucosuria may occur without any other abnormalities of renal function or as part of a generalized defect in proximal tubule function (Fanconi syndrome).
It also may occur with various systemic disorders, including cystinosis, Wilson disease, hereditary tyrosinemia, and oculocerebrorenal syndrome (Lowe syndrome).
Symptoms and Signs of Renal Glucosuria Renal glucosuria is asymptomatic and without serious sequelae.
However, if there is an associated generalized defect in proximal tubular function, symptoms and signs may include hypophosphatemic rickets, volume depletion, short stature, muscle hypotonia, and ocular changes of cataracts or glaucoma (oculocerebrorenal syndrome) or Kayser-Fleischer rings (Wilson disease).
Isolated Hematuria By Geetha Maddukuri, MD, Saint Louis University Reviewed / Revised Dec 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Etiology Evaluation Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Some Common Specific Causes... Hematuria is red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, specifically > 3 RBCs per high-power field on urine sediment examination.
The most common specific causes differ somewhat by age, but overall the most common are Urinary tract infections (UTIs) Prostatitis Urinary calculi (in adults) Congenital or acquired anatomic abnormalities Cancers Vigorous exercise may cause transient hematuria.
Cancer and prostate disease are a concern mainly in patients > 50, although younger patients with risk factors may develop cancer.
Glomerular disorders can be a cause at all ages.
Glomerular disorders may represent a primary renal disorder (acquired or hereditary) or be secondary to many causes, including infections (eg, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection), connective tissue disorders and vasculitis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] at all ages, immunoglobulin A-associated vasculitis [Henoch-Schönlein purpura] in children), and blood disorders (eg, mixed cryoglobulinemia, serum sickness).
Worldwide, IgA nephropathy is the most common form of glomerulonephritis.
Thin basement membrane disease and mild IgA nephropathy may cause isolated hematuria; however, most other glomerular causes of hematuria are accompanied by proteinuria.
Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic fluke that causes significant disease in Africa (and, to a lesser extent, in India and parts of the Middle East), can invade the urinary tract, causing hematuria.
Schistosomiasis is considered only if people have spent time in endemic areas.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis may also infect the lower or upper urinary tract and cause hematuria, occasionally causing urethral strictures.
Other causes of hematuria include Urinary tract instrumentation or procedure (eg, Foley catheterization, prostate or kidney biopsy, lithotripsy) Radiation cystitis Drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis Vascular etiology—which is rare (eg, renal infarction, renal vein embolism, renal arteriovenous malformation) Table Evaluation of Isolated Hematuria History History of present illness includes duration of hematuria and any previous episodes.
Urine may be red, bloody, or cola-colored (gross hematuria with oxidation of blood retained in the bladder) or not visibly discolored (microscopic hematuria).
Urinary obstructive symptoms (eg, incomplete emptying, nocturia, difficulty starting or stopping) and irritative symptoms (eg, irritation, urgency, frequency, dysuria) should be noted.
Patients should be asked about the presence of pain and its location and severity and whether they have vigorously exercised.
Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including joint pain and rashes (connective tissue disorder), and hearing loss or ocular manifestations (hereditary nephritis, also called Alport syndrome).
Presence of fever, night sweats, or weight loss should also be noted.
Past medical history should include questions about any recent infections, particularly a sore throat that may indicate a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Conditions known to cause urinary tract bleeding (particularly kidney calculi, sickle cell disease or trait, and glomerular disorders) should be sought, along with any history of congenital urinary tract anomalies.
Also, conditions that predispose to a glomerular disorder, such as a connective tissue disorder (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] and rheumatoid arthritis), endocarditis, shunt infections, and abdominal abscesses, should be identified.
Risk factors for genitourinary (GU) cancer should be identified, including smoking (the most significant), drugs (eg, cyclophosphamide, phenacetin), and exposure to industrial chemicals (eg, nitrates, nitrilotriacetate, nitrites, trichloroethylene).
Family history should identify relatives with known polycystic kidney disease, a glomerular disorder, or GU cancer.
Patients should be asked about travel to areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, and tuberculosis risk factors should be assessed.
Isolated hematuria is urinary RBCs without other urine abnormalities (eg, proteinuria, casts).
Drug history should note use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (although controlled anticoagulation itself does not cause hematuria), and heavy analgesic use.
Physical examination Vital signs should be reviewed for fever and hypertension.
The heart should be auscultated for murmurs (suggesting endocarditis).
The abdomen should be palpated for masses; flanks should be percussed for tenderness over the kidneys.
In men, a digital rectal examination should be done to check for prostate enlargement, nodules, and tenderness.
The face and extremities should be inspected for edema (suggesting a glomerular disorder), and the skin should be inspected for rashes (suggesting vasculitis, SLE, or immunoglobulin A-associated vasculitis).
Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Gross hematuria and concurrent proteinuria Persistent microscopic hematuria, especially in older patients Age > 50 Hypertension and edema Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats, weight loss) Interpretation of findings Clinical manifestations of the various causes overlap significantly, so urine and often blood tests are required.
Depending on results, imaging tests may then be needed.
However, some clinical findings provide helpful clues (see table Some Common Causes of Hematuria).
Blood clots in urine essentially rule out a glomerular disorder.
Red urine is not always due to RBCs.
Glomerular disorders are often accompanied by edema, hypertension, or both; symptoms may be preceded by an infection (particularly a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection in children).
Calculi usually manifest with excruciating, colicky pain.
Less severe, more continuous pain is more likely to result from infection, cancer, polycystic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, and loin pain-hematuria syndrome.
Urinary irritative symptoms suggest bladder or prostate infection but may accompany certain cancers (mainly bladder and prostate).
Urinary obstructive symptoms usually suggest prostate disease.
An abdominal mass suggests polycystic kidney disease or renal cell carcinoma.
A family history of nephritis, sickle cell disease or trait, or polycystic kidney disease suggests that as a cause.
Travel to Africa, the Middle East, or India suggests the possibility of schistosomiasis.
Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats, weight loss) may indicate cancer or subacute infection (eg, tuberculosis [TB]) or an autoimmune (connective tissue) disorder.
On the other hand, some common findings (eg, prostate enlargement, excessive anticoagulation), although potential causes of hematuria, should not be assumed to be the cause without further evaluation.
Red or reddish brown discoloration may result from the following: Hemoglobin or myoglobin in urine Porphyria (most types) Foods (eg, beets, rhubarb, sometimes food coloring) Drugs (most commonly phenazopyridine, but sometimes cascara, diphenylhydantoin, methyldopa, phenacetin, phenindione, phenolphthalein, phenothiazine, and senna) Pathophysiology of Isolated Hematuria Red blood cells (RBCs) may enter urine from anywhere along the urinary tract—from the kidneys, collecting system and ureters, prostate, bladder, and urethra.
Testing Before testing proceeds, true hematuria should be distinguished from red urine by urinalysis.
In women with vaginal bleeding, the specimen should be obtained by straight catheterization to avoid contamination by a nonurinary source of blood.
Red urine without red blood cells (RBCs) suggests myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria, porphyria, or ingestion of certain drugs or foods.
Generally, the presence of hematuria should be confirmed by testing a 2nd specimen.
Presence of casts, protein, or dysmorphic RBCs (unusually shaped, with spicules, folding, and blebs) indicates a glomerular disorder.
White blood cells or bacteria suggest an infectious etiology.
However, because urinalysis shows predominantly RBCs in some patients with cystitis, urine culture is usually done.
A positive culture result warrants treatment with antibiotics.
If hematuria resolves after treatment and no other symptoms are present, no further evaluation is required for patients < 50, especially women.
If patients < 35 (including children) have only microscopic hematuria and no urine findings suggesting a glomerular disorder, no clinical manifestations suggesting a cause, no risk factors for cancer, and an identified benign cause (eg, infection, mild trauma), they can be observed, with urinalysis repeated every 6 to 12 months.
In females, normal or abnormal uterine bleeding may be misdiagnosed as hematuria.
If a benign cause is not evident or hematuria is persistent, testing is indicated (1), beginning with ultrasonography or CT with contrast, sometimes followed by cystoscopy.
Patients < 50 with gross hematuria or unexplained systemic symptoms require ultrasonography or CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
If urine or clinical findings suggest a glomerular disorder, renal function is evaluated by measuring blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and electrolytes; doing a urinalysis; and periodically determining the urine protein / creatinine ratio.
Further evaluation of a glomerular disorder may require serologic tests, kidney biopsy, or both.
All patients ≥ 35 require cystoscopy, as do patients who are < 35 but have risk factors, such as a family history of cancer, or systemic symptoms (1).
Etiology of Isolated Hematuria Most cases involve transient microscopic hematuria that is self-limited and idiopathic.
Urinalysis and urine sediment examination help differentiate glomerular from nonglomerular causes.
Risk of serious disease increases with aging and with duration and degree of hematuria.
Cystoscopy and imaging tests are usually needed for patients > 35 or for younger patients with systemic symptoms or risk factors for cancer.
Transient microscopic hematuria is particularly common in children, present in up to 5% of their urine samples.
Brain Abscess By John E Greenlee, MD, University of Utah Health Reviewed / Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Cerebellar Abscess A brain abscess is an intracerebral collection of pus.
Enterobacteriaceae may be isolated in chronic ear infections.
After chronic suppurative otitis media, anaerobic bacteria, streptococci, and gram-negative bacteria are common causes.
Fungi (eg, Aspergillus) and protozoa (eg, Toxoplasma gondii, particularly in HIV-infected patients) can cause abscesses.
Symptoms and Signs of Brain Abscess Symptoms result from increased intracranial pressure, mass effect, and sometimes focal brain injury.
Classically, headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, personality changes, papilledema, and focal neurologic deficits develop over days to weeks; however, in some patients, these manifestations are subtle or absent until late in the clinical course.
Fever, chills, and leukocytosis may develop before the infection is encapsulated, but they may be absent at presentation, subside over time, or not develop.
Diagnosis of Brain Abscess Contrast-enhanced MRI or, if unavailable, contrast-enhanced CT When symptoms suggest an abscess, contrast-enhanced MRI with diffusion-weighted images or, if MRI is unavailable, contrast-enhanced CT is done.
A fully developed abscess appears as an edematous mass with ring enhancement, which may be difficult to distinguish from a brain tumor or occasionally infarction; CT-guided aspiration, culture, surgical excision, or a combination may be necessary.
Culturing pus aspirated from the abscess can make targeted antibiotic therapy of the abscess possible.
However, antibiotics should not be withheld until culture results are available.
Symptoms may include headache, lethargy, fever, and focal neurologic deficits.
Lumbar puncture is not done because it may precipitate transtentorial herniation and because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are nonspecific (see table Cerebrospinal Fluid Abnormalities in Various Disorders).
Treatment of Brain Abscess Antibiotics (initially cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole for Bacteroides species or plus vancomycin for Staphylococcus aureus based on suspicion, then as guided by culture and susceptibility testing) Usually CT-guided stereotactic aspiration or surgical drainage Sometimes corticosteroids, antiseizure drugs, or both All patients receive antibiotics for a minimum of 4 to 8 weeks.
Initial empiric antibiotics include one of the following: Cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4 hours Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours Both are effective against streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and most anaerobes but not against Bacteroides fragilis.
If clinicians suspect Bacteroides species (as in chronic sinusitis or otitis), metronidazole 15 mg / kg (loading dose) followed by 7.5 mg / kg IV every 6 hours is also required.
If S aureus is suspected (eg, after cranial trauma or neurosurgery or in endocarditis), vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours is used (with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) until sensitivity to nafcillin (2 g every 4 hours) is determined.
Response to antibiotics is best monitored by serial MRI or CT Drainage (CT-guided stereotactic or open) provides optimal therapy and is necessary for most abscesses that are solitary and surgically accessible, particularly those > 2 cm in diameter.
If abscesses are < 2 cm in diameter, antibiotics alone may be tried, but abscesses must then be monitored with frequent serial MRI or CT (initially as often as every 2 to 3 days); if abscesses enlarge after being treated with antibiotics, surgical drainage is indicated.
Patients with increased intracranial pressure (assessed by signs and neuroimaging findings) may benefit from a short course of high-dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg IV once, then 4 mg IV every 6 hours for 3 or 4 days).
Antiseizure drugs are frequently used to prevent seizures.
Rate of recovery depends on how successful the abscesses are eradicated and the patient's immune status.
Diagnosis is by contrast-enhanced MRI or CT.
If immunocompromised patients (eg, patients with uncontrolled HIV infection) have an abscess due to Toxoplasma gondii or a fungus, they may have to take antibiotics for the rest of their life.
Key Points Brain abscess can result from direct extension (eg, of mastoiditis, osteomyelitis, sinusitis, or subdural empyema), penetrating wounds (including neurosurgery), or hematogenous spread.
Headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, personality changes, papilledema, and focal neurologic deficits develop over days to weeks; fever may be absent at presentation.
Do contrast-enhanced MRI or, if MRI is unavailable, contrast-enhanced CT.
Treat all brain abscesses with antibiotics (usually initially with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus metronidazole if clinicians suspect Bacteroides species or plus vancomycin if they suspect S aureus), typically followed by CT-guided stereotactic aspiration or surgical drainage.
If abscesses are < 2 cm in diameter, they may be treated with antibiotics alone but must then be monitored closely with MRI or CT; if abscesses enlarge after being treated with antibiotics, surgical drainage is indicated.
Treatment is with antibiotics and usually CT-guided stereotactic aspiration or surgical drainage.
An abscess forms when an area of cerebral inflammation becomes necrotic and encapsulated by glial cells and fibroblasts.
Edema around the abscess may increase intracranial pressure, as may the abscess itself.
Etiology of Brain Abscess A brain abscess can result from Direct extension of cranial infections (eg, osteomyelitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis, subdural empyema) Penetrating head wounds (including neurosurgical procedures) Hematogenous spread (eg, in bacterial endocarditis, congenital heart disease with right-to-left shunt, or IV drug abuse) Unknown causes The bacteria involved are usually anaerobic and sometimes mixed, often including anaerobes, such as Bacteroides and anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci.
Staphylococci are commonly involved after cranial trauma, neurosurgery, or endocarditis.
Table Antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease Antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease is an autoimmune glomerulonephritis and accounts for up to 10% of RPGN cases.
It may arise when respiratory exposures (eg, cigarette smoke, viral upper respiratory infection) or some other stimulus exposes alveolar capillary collagen, triggering formation of anticollagen antibodies.
The anticollagen antibodies cross-react with GBM, fixing complement and triggering a cell-mediated inflammatory response in the kidneys and usually the lungs.
The term Goodpasture syndrome refers to a combination of glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage in the presence of anti-GBM antibodies.
Glomerulonephritis without alveolar hemorrhage in the presence of anti-GBM antibodies is called anti-GBM glomerulonephritis.
Immunofluorescent staining of renal biopsy tissue demonstrates linear IgG deposits.
Immunofluorescent staining demonstrates nonspecific granular immune deposits.
The condition accounts for up to 40% of RPGN cases.
Pathogenesis is usually unknown.
Pauci-immune RPGN Pauci-immune RPGN is distinguished by the absence of immune complex or complement deposition on immunofluorescent staining.
It constitutes up to 50% of all RPGN cases.
Almost all patients have elevated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), usually antiproteinase 3-ANCA or myeloperoxidase-ANCA, and systemic vasculitis.
Double-antibody disease Double-antibody disease occurs with the presence of anti-GBM and ANCA antibodies.
They include patients with either of the following: Immune complexes but no obvious cause such as infection, systemic rheumatic disease, or glomerular disorder Pauci-immune features but absence of ANCA antibodies Symptoms and Signs of RPGN Manifestations are usually insidious, with weakness, fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and abdominal pain.
Some patients present similarly to those with postinfectious glomerulonephritis, with abrupt-onset hematuria.
About 50% of patients have edema and a history of an acute influenza-like illness within 4 weeks of onset of renal failure, usually followed by severe oliguria.
Nephrotic syndrome is present in 10 to 30%.
Hypertension is uncommon and rarely severe.
Patients with anti-GBM antibody disease may have pulmonary hemorrhage, which can manifest with hemoptysis or be detectable only by findings suggestive of diffuse alveolar infiltrates on lung imaging (pulmonary-renal syndrome or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndrome).
Diagnosis of RPGN Progressive renal failure over weeks to months Nephritic urinary sediment Serologic testing Serum complement levels Renal biopsy Diagnosis is suggested by acute kidney injury in patients with hematuria and dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs) or RBC casts.
Testing includes serum creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), serologic tests, and renal biopsy.
Diagnosis is usually by serologic tests and renal biopsy.
Serum creatinine is almost always elevated.
Urinalysis shows hematuria is always present, and RBC casts are usually present.
Telescopic sediment (ie, sediment with multiple elements, including white blood cells [WBCs]; dysmorphic RBCs; and WBC, RBC, granular, waxy, and broad casts) is common.
On CBC, anemia is usually present, and leukocytosis is common.
Serologic testing should include anti-GBM antibodies (anti-GBM antibody disease); antistreptolysin O antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, or cryoglobulins (immune complex RPGN); and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers (pauci-immune RPGN).
The feature common to all types of RPGN is focal proliferation of glomerular epithelial cells, sometimes interspersed with numerous neutrophils, that forms a crescentic cellular mass (crescents) and that fills Bowman space in > 50% of glomeruli.
The glomerular tuft usually appears hypocellular and collapses.
Necrosis within the tuft or involving the crescent may occur and may be the most prominent abnormality.
In such patients, histologic evidence of vasculitis should be sought.
Immunofluorescence microscopy findings differ for each type: In anti-GBM antibody disease, linear or ribbon-like deposition of IgG along the GBM is most prominent and is often accompanied by linear and sometimes granular deposition of C3.
In immune complex RPGN, immunofluorescence reveals diffuse, irregular mesangial IgG and C3 deposits.
In pauci-immune RPGN, immune staining and deposits are not detected.
However, fibrin occurs within the crescents, regardless of the fluorescence pattern.
Diagnosis is based on history, urinalysis, serologic tests, and renal biopsy.
In double antibody RPGN, linear staining of the GBM is present.
In idiopathic RPGN, some patients have immune complexes and others have absence of immune staining and deposits.
Treatment of RPGN Corticosteroids Cyclophosphamide Rituximab Plasma exchange Treatment varies by disease type, although no regimens have been rigorously studied.
Therapy should be instituted early, ideally when serum creatinine is < 5 mg / dL (442 micromol / L) and before the biopsy shows crescentic involvement of all glomeruli or organizing crescents as well as fibrotic interstitium and atrophic tubules.
Even patients with kidney involvement and higher creatinine levels should be aggressively treated if they do not require immediate renal replacement therapy.
Treatment becomes less effective as these features become more prominent and may be harmful in some patients (eg, older patients, patients with infection).
Corticosteroids and either cyclophosphamide or rituximab are usually given.
For immune complex and pauci-immune disease, corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g IV once a day over 30 minutes for 3 to 5 days followed by prednisone 1 mg / kg orally once a day) may reduce serum creatinine levels or delay dialysis for > 3 years in 50% of patients (1, 2).
Cyclophosphamide is usually given and may particularly benefit antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) - positive patients; IV monthly pulse regimens may cause fewer adverse effects (eg, leukopenia, infection) than oral therapy because of reduced cumulative dosing.
Prednisone and cyclophosphamide are typically started concurrent with plasma exchange for anti-GBM (glomerular basement membrane) antibody disease and continued to minimize new antibody formation.
Treatment is with corticosteroids, with or without cyclophosphamide or rituximab, and sometimes plasma exchange.
Patients with idiopathic disease are usually treated with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, but data regarding efficacy are scarce.
Rituximab may be dosed at 375 mg / m 2 IV per week for 4 weeks as used in the RAVE trial (formal title: R ituximab in A NCA-Associated V asculitis; [2]).
An alternative regimen is an initial dose of 1g followed by another 1-g dose 2 weeks later.
Rituximab has not been used in the treatment of anti-GBM disease.
Plasma exchange (daily 3 - to 4-L exchanges for 14 days) is recommended for anti-GBM antibody disease.
Plasma exchange may also be considered for immune complex and pauci-immune ANCA-associated RPGN with pulmonary hemorrhage or severe renal dysfunction on presentation (serum creatinine > 5 to 7 mg / dL [442 to 618.8 micromol / L] or dialysis dependency), but its use remains controversial.
Plasma exchange is thought to rapidly remove free antibody, intact immune complexes, and mediators of inflammation (eg, fibrinogen, complement).
Aggressive immunosuppressive therapy may also be beneficial in patients who present with higher creatinine levels.
Plasmapheresis combined with prednisone and cyclophosphamide benefited patients with renal involvement who did not require immediate renal replacement therapy, even if creatinine levels were elevated above 5 to 7 mg / dL (442 to 618.8 micromol / L; [4]).
Kidney transplantation is effective for all types, but disease may recur in the graft; risk diminishes with time.
In anti-GBM antibody disease, the anti-GBM titers should be undetectable for at least 12 months before transplantation.
It is relatively uncommon, affecting 10 to 15% of patients with glomerulonephritis, and occurs predominantly in patients 20 to 50 years.
Key Points Consider rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis if patients have acute kidney injury with hematuria and dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts, particularly with subacute constitutional or nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever, anorexia, arthralgia, abdominal pain).
Evaluate with serologic tests and early renal biopsy.
Types and causes are classified by findings using immunofluorescence microscopy and serologic tests (eg, anti-glomerular basement membrane [GBM] antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA] —see table).
Initiate treatment early, with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and in some cases plasma exchange.
Consider kidney transplantation after disease activity is controlled.
Renal biopsy is unnecessary but is often done as part of a hematuria evaluation.
Early on, thin basement membrane disease may be difficult to differentiate from Alport sydrome because of histologic similarities.
Treatment of Thin Basement Membrane Disease For frequent gross hematuria, flank pain, or proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) Long-term prognosis is excellent, and no treatment is necessary in most cases.
Patients with frequent gross hematuria, flank pain, or proteinuria (eg, urine protein / creatinine ratio of > 0.2) may benefit from ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which may lower intraglomerular pressure.
Thin basement membrane disease is a type of nephritic syndrome.
It is hereditary and usually transmitted in autosomal dominant fashion.
Not all genetic mutations have been characterized, but in some families with thin basement membrane disease there is a mutation in the type IV collagen alpha-4 gene.
Prevalence is estimated to be 5 to 9%.
Symptoms and Signs of Thin Basement Membrane Disease Most patients are asymptomatic and are incidentally noted to have microscopic hematuria on routine urinalysis, although mild proteinuria and gross hematuria are occasionally present.
Renal function is typically normal, but a few patients develop progressive renal failure for unknown reasons.
Recurrent flank pain, similar to that in immunoglobulin A nephropathy, is a rare manifestation.
Diagnosis of Thin Basement Membrane Disease Clinical evaluation Sometimes renal biopsy Diagnosis is based on family history and findings of hematuria without other symptoms or pathology, particularly if asymptomatic family members also have hematuria.
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) By Ji Y Chong, MD, Weill Cornell Medical College Reviewed / Revised Apr 2020 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Etiology Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Prognosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources QT Interval Correction (EKG) Mean Vascular Pressure (systemic... Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Subarachnoid hemorrhage is sudden bleeding into the subarachnoid space.
A congenital intracranial saccular or berry aneurysm is the cause in about 85% of patients.
Bleeding may stop spontaneously.
Aneurysmal hemorrhage may occur at any age but is most common from age 40 to 65.
Less common causes are mycotic aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and bleeding disorders.
Pathophysiology of SAH Blood in the subarachnoid space causes a chemical meningitis that commonly increases intracranial pressure for days or a few weeks.
Secondary vasospasm may cause focal brain ischemia; about 25% of patients develop signs of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke.
Brain edema is maximal and risk of vasospasm and subsequent infarction (called angry brain) is highest between 72 hours and 10 days.
Secondary acute hydrocephalus is also common.
A 2nd rupture (rebleeding) sometimes occurs, most often within about 7 days.
Symptoms and Signs of SAH Headache is usually severe, peaking within seconds.
The most common cause of spontaneous bleeding is a ruptured aneurysm.
Loss of consciousness may follow, usually immediately but sometimes not for several hours.
Severe neurologic deficits may develop and become irreversible within minutes or a few hours.
Sensorium may be impaired, and patients may become restless.
Seizures are possible.
Usually, the neck is not stiff initially unless the cerebellar tonsils herniate.
However, within 24 hours, chemical meningitis causes moderate to marked meningismus, vomiting, and sometimes bilateral extensor plantar responses.
Heart or respiratory rate is often abnormal.
Fever, continued headaches, and confusion are common during the first 5 to 10 days.
Secondary hydrocephalus may cause headache, obtundation, and motor deficits that persist for weeks.
Rebleeding may cause recurrent or new symptoms.
Symptoms include sudden, severe headache, usually with loss or impairment of consciousness.
Diagnosis of SAH Usually noncontrast CT and, if negative, lumbar puncture Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is suggested by characteristic symptoms.
Testing should proceed as rapidly as possible, before damage becomes irreversible.
Noncontrast CT is done within 6 hours of symptom onset.
MRI is comparably sensitive but less likely to be immediately available.
False-negative results occur if volume of blood is small or if the patient is so anemic that blood is isodense with brain tissue.
If subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected clinically but not identified by neuroimaging or if neuroimaging is not immediately available, lumbar puncture is done.
Lumbar puncture is contraindicated if increased intracranial pressure is suspected because the sudden decrease in cerebrospinal (CSF) pressure may lessen the tamponade of a clot on the ruptured aneurysm, causing further bleeding.
Pearls & Pitfalls Suspect subarachnoid hemorrhage if headache reaches peak, severe intensity within seconds of onset or causes loss of consciousness.
Do lumbar puncture if subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected clinically but CT shows no hemorrhage or is not available; however, lumbar puncture is contraindicated if increased intracranial pressure is suspected.
CSF findings suggesting subarachnoid hemorrhage include Numerous red blood cells (RBCs) Xanthochromia Increased pressure RBCs in CSF may also be caused by traumatic lumbar puncture.
Secondary vasospasm (causing focal brain ischemia), meningismus, and hydrocephalus (causing persistent headache and obtundation) are common.
Traumatic lumbar puncture is suspected if the RBC count decreases in tubes of CSF drawn sequentially during the same lumbar puncture.
About 6 hours or more after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, RBCs become crenated and lyse, resulting in a xanthochromic CSF supernatant and visible crenated RBCs (noted during microscopic CSF examination); these findings usually indicate that subarachnoid hemorrhage preceded the lumbar puncture.
If there is still doubt, hemorrhage should be assumed, or the lumbar puncture should be repeated in 8 to 12 hours.
In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, conventional cerebral angiography is done as soon as possible after the initial bleeding episode; alternatives include magnetic resonance angiography and CT angiography.
All 4 arteries (2 carotid and 2 vertebral arteries) should be injected because up to 20% of patients (mostly women) have multiple aneurysms.
On ECG, subarachnoid hemorrhage may cause ST-segment elevation or depression.
It can cause syncope, mimicking myocardial infarction.
Other possible ECG abnormalities include prolongation of the QRS or QT intervals and peaking or deep, symmetric inversion of T waves.
Prognosis for SAH About 35% of patients die after the first aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; another 15% die within a few weeks because of a subsequent rupture.
After 6 months, a 2nd rupture occurs at a rate of about 3% / year.
Diagnosis is by CT or MRI; if neuroimaging is normal, diagnosis is by cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
In general, prognosis is grave with an aneurysm, better with an arteriovenous malformation, and best when 4-vessel angiography does not detect a lesion, presumably because the bleeding source is small and has sealed itself.
Among survivors, neurologic damage is common, even when treatment is optimal.
Treatment of SAH Treatment in a comprehensive stroke center Nicardipine if mean arterial pressure is > 130 mm Hg Nimodipine to prevent vasospasm Occlusion of causative aneurysms Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage should be treated in a comprehensive stroke center whenever possible.
Hypertension should be treated only if mean arterial pressure is > 130 mm Hg; euvolemia is maintained, and IV nicardipine is titrated as for intracerebral hemorrhage (1).
Bed rest is mandatory.
Restlessness and headache are treated symptomatically.
Stool softeners are given to prevent constipation, which can lead to straining.
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs are contraindicated.
Vasospasm is prevented by giving nimodipine 60 mg orally every 4 hours for 21 days to prevent vasospasm, but BP needs to be maintained in the desirable range (usually considered to be a mean arterial pressure of 70 to 130 mm Hg and a systolic pressure of 120 to 185 mm Hg).
If clinical signs of acute hydrocephalus occur, ventricular drainage should be considered.
Treatment is with supportive measures and neurosurgery or endovascular measures, preferably in a comprehensive stroke center.
Aneurysms are occluded to reduce risk of rebleeding.
Detachable endovascular coils can be inserted during angiography to occlude the aneurysm.
Alternatively, if the aneurysm is accessible, surgery to clip or stent the aneurysm can be done, especially for patients with an evacuable hematoma or acute hydrocephalus.
If patients are arousable, most vascular neurosurgeons operate within the first 24 hours to minimize risk of rebleeding and risks due to angry brain.
Key Points Possible complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage include chemical meningitis, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, rebleeding, and brain edema.
Suspect subarachnoid hemorrhage if headache is severe at onset and reaches peak intensity within seconds or causes loss of consciousness.
Etiology of SAH Subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding between the arachnoid and pia mater.
If subarachnoid hemorrhage is confirmed, scan both carotid and both vertebral arteries using conventional cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT angiography because many patients have multiple aneurysms.
If possible, send patients to a comprehensive stroke center for treatment.
In general, head trauma is the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage, but traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually considered a separate disorder.
Spontaneous (primary) subarachnoid hemorrhage usually results from ruptured aneurysms.
Renal Atheroembolism By Zhiwei Zhang, MD, Loma Linda University School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Mar 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Prognosis Key Points Topic Resources Renal Atheroembolism Renal Cortical Necrosis Renal atheroembolism is occlusion of renal arterioles by atherosclerotic emboli, causing progressive chronic kidney disease.
A foreign body immune reaction often follows embolization, leading to continued deterioration in renal function for 3 to 8 weeks.
Acute renal impairment may also result from massive or recurrent episodes of embolization.
Symptoms and Signs of Renal Atheroembolism Symptoms are usually those of acute or chronic renal dysfunction with uremia (see Acute Kidney Injury [AKI]: Symptoms).
Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting can result from concomitant compromised arterial microcirculation of abdominal organs (eg, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract).
Sudden blindness and formation of bright yellow retinal plaques (Hollenhorst plaques) can result from emboli in retinal arterioles.
Signs of widespread peripheral embolism (eg, livedo reticularis, painful muscle nodules, overt gangrene, which is often referred to as the trash syndrome) are sometimes present.
Diagnosis of Renal Atheroembolism Clinical suspicion Sometimes, renal biopsy Location of source of emboli Diagnosis is suggested by worsening renal function in a patient with recent manipulation of the aorta, particularly if there are signs of atheroemboli.
Differential diagnosis includes contrast-induced and drug-induced nephropathy.
If suspicion of atheroembolism remains high, percutaneous renal biopsy is done; it has a sensitivity of about 75%.
Diagnosis is important because there may be treatable causes of emboli in the absence of vascular obstruction.
It results from rupture of atheromatous plaques.
Cholesterol crystals in the emboli dissolve during tissue fixation, leaving pathognomonic biconcave, needle-shaped clefts in the occluded vessel.
Sometimes skin, muscle, or gastrointestinal biopsy can provide the same information and indirectly help establish the diagnosis.
Blood and urine tests can confirm the diagnosis of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease but do not establish cause.
Urinalysis typically shows microscopic hematuria and minimal proteinuria; however, proteinuria is occasionally in the nephrotic range (> 3 g / day).
Eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and transient hypocomplementemia may be present.
If renal or systemic emboli recur and their source is unclear, transesophageal echocardiography is done to detect atheromatous lesions in the ascending and thoracic aorta and cardiac sources of emboli; dual helical CT may help characterize the ascending aorta and aortic arch.
Treatment of Renal Atheroembolism Treatment of embolic source when possible Supportive measures Modification of risk factors Sometimes the source of emboli can be treated (eg, anticoagulation for patients with emboli from a cardiac source and atrial fibrillation and for patients in whom a clot becomes a source of new emboli).
However, no direct treatment of existing renal emboli is effective.
Corticosteroids, antiplatelet medications, vasodilators, and plasma exchange are not helpful.
There is no demonstrated benefit of anticoagulation and, according to most experts, its use may actually enhance atheroembolism.
Symptoms are those of renal failure; symptoms and signs of widespread arterial embolic disease may be present.
Treatment of renal dysfunction includes control of hypertension and management of electrolytes and fluid status; sometimes dialysis is required.
Modifying risk factors for atherosclerosis may slow its progression and induce regression.
Strategies include management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; smoking cessation; and encouragement of regular aerobic exercise and good nutrition (Atherosclerosis: Treatment).
Prognosis for Renal Atheroembolism Patients with renal atheroemboli have a poor overall prognosis.
Key Points Renal atheroembolism usually results from manipulation of the aorta during vascular surgery, angioplasty, or arteriography, and rarely from spontaneous atherosclerotic embolization.
Suspect the diagnosis if renal function deteriorates after the aorta or another large artery is manipulated.
Confirm the diagnosis based on clinical findings and occasionally with percutaneous renal biopsy.
Treat supportively, correcting modifiable risk factors and, when possible, treating the embolic source; however, the overall prognosis remains poor.
Long-term prognosis is usually poor.
Treatment aims to prevent further embolization.
Atheromatous plaque rupture usually results from manipulation of the aorta or other large arteries during vascular surgery, angioplasty, or arteriography.
Spontaneous plaque rupture, which occurs most often in patients who have diffuse erosive atherosclerosis or who are being treated with anticoagulants or fibrinolytics, is rare.
Atheroemboli tend to cause incomplete occlusion with secondary ischemic atrophy rather than renal infarction.
Tigecycline By Brian J Werth, PharmD, University of Washington School of Pharmacy Reviewed / Revised May 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Pharmacokinetics Indications Contraindications Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Adverse Effects Dosing Considerations Tigecycline, a derivative of the tetracycline minocycline, is the first available glycylcycline antibiotic.
Tigecycline has in vitro activity against the following: Many gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae that are penicillin-susceptible, and vancomycin - susceptible Enterococcus faecalis Many gram-negative bacteria, such as multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae, and most Enterobacterales (formerly Enterobacteriaceae; including some strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [ESBLs] and other strains that were carbapenem-resistant based on production of a carbapenemase or metallo-beta-lactamase) Many atypical respiratory pathogens (chlamydiae, Mycoplasma species), Mycobacterium abscessus, M fortuitum, and anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) It is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia species, Morganella morganii, or Proteus species.
Tigecycline is indicated for Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections Complicated intra-abdominal infections Community-acquired pneumonia However, a recent meta-analysis showed that patients treated with tigecycline (particularly those treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia) had a higher mortality than those given other antibiotics, resulting in a black box warning from the U S.Food and Drug Administration.
In general, tigecycline should be reserved for infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms when other treatment options are more toxic or less effective.
Because of its parenteral activity against C difficile, tigecycline may be a useful antibiotic when a patient requires concurrent treatment of an MDR infection and a C difficile infection.
Contraindications to Tigecycline Tigecycline is contraindicated in patients who have had an allergic reaction to it and in children < 8 years of age.
Tigecycline has a black box warning because it increases the risk of mortality and so should be reserved for situations where there are no suitable alternatives.
Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Tigecycline, like tetracyclines, can affect fetal bones and teeth.
If a pregnant woman takes it during the 2nd or 3rd trimester, it may cause permanent discoloration of the fetus's teeth.
Whether tigecycline enters breast milk and is safe to use during breastfeeding is unknown; however, it has limited oral bioavailability.
Adverse Effects of Tigecycline Adverse effects of tigecycline include Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Photosensitivity Hepatotoxicity Nausea and vomiting are common.
Tigecycline inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.
Increases in serum amylase, total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time, and transaminases can occur in patients treated with tigecycline.
Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been reported in patients being treated with tigecycline.
Many of tigecycline 's adverse effects are similar to those of tetracyclines (eg, photosensitivity).
Dosing Considerations for Tigecycline Dose is adjusted in patients with hepatic dysfunction but not in those with renal dysfunction.
Serum levels of warfarin may increase, but international normalized ratio does not appear to increase.
It is bacteriostatic.
Pharmacokinetics Tigecycline is given IV.
Tigecycline has a large volume of distribution (> 12 L / kg), penetrating well into bone, lung, liver, and kidney tissues.
However, because of its extensive distribution into tissue, blood levels are low, so tigecycline is probably not a good choice for patients with bacteremia especially those with intravascular sources of infection.
Most of the drug is excreted in bile and feces.
No dosing adjustment is required in patients who have renal insufficiency.
Indications for Tigecycline Tigecycline is effective against many resistant bacteria, including those with resistance to tetracyclines.
Sulfonamides By Brian J Werth, PharmD, University of Washington School of Pharmacy Reviewed / Revised May 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Pharmacokinetics Indications Contraindications Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Adverse Effects Dosing Considerations Topic Resources Mechanisms of Action: Folic... Sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics that competitively inhibit conversion of p - aminobenzoic acid to dihydropteroate, which bacteria need for folate synthesis and ultimately purine and DNA synthesis.
They are metabolized mainly by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.
Sulfonamides compete for bilirubin-binding sites on albumin.
Indications for Sulfonamides Sulfonamides are active against A broad spectrum of gram-positive and many gram-negative bacteria Plasmodium and Toxoplasma species Sulfasalazine can be used orally for inflammatory bowel disease.
Sulfonamides are most commonly used with other drugs (eg, for nocardiosis, urinary tract infection, and chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria).
Topical sulfonamides can be used to treat the following: Burns: Silver sulfadiazine and mafenide acetate Vaginitis: Vaginal cream and suppositories with sulfanilamide Superficial ocular infections: Ophthalmic sulfacetamide Contraindications to Sulfonamides Sulfonamides are contraindicated in patients who have had an allergic reaction to them or who have porphyria.
Sulfonamides do not eradicate group A streptococci in patients with pharyngitis and should not be used to treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Evidence regarding an association between sulfonamides and birth defects is mixed.
Animal studies with sulfonamides show some risk, and adequate studies have not been done in pregnant women.
Use near term and in breastfeeding mothers is contraindicated, as is use in patients < 2 months of age (except as adjunctive therapy with pyrimethamine to treat congenital toxoplasmosis).
If used near term during pregnancy or in neonates, these drugs increase blood levels of unconjugated bilirubin and increase risk of kernicterus in the fetus or neonate.
Humans do not synthesize folate but acquire it in their diet, so their DNA synthesis is less affected.
Sulfonamides enter breast milk.
Adverse Effects of Sulfonamides Adverse effects of sulfonamides can result from oral and sometimes topical sulfonamides; effects include Hypersensitivity reactions, such as rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, vasculitis, serum sickness, drug fever, anaphylaxis, and angioedema Crystalluria, oliguria, and anuria Hematologic reactions, such as agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and, in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, hemolytic anemia Kernicterus in neonates Photosensitivity Neurologic effects, such as insomnia, and headache Hypothyroidism, hepatitis, and activation of quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus may occur in patients taking sulfonamides.
These drugs can exacerbate porphyrias.
Incidence of adverse effects is different for the various sulfonamides, but cross-sensitivity is common.
Sulfasalazine can reduce intestinal absorption of folate (folic acid).
Thus, use of this drug may trigger folate deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which also reduces absorption, especially if dietary intake is also inadequate.
Mafenide may cause metabolic acidosis by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase.
Dosing Considerations for Sulfonamides To avoid crystalluria, clinicians should hydrate patients well (eg, to produce a urinary output of 1200 to 1500 mL / day).
Sulfonamides can be used in patients with renal insufficiency, but peak plasma levels should be measured and sulfamethoxazole levels should not exceed 120 mcg / mL.
Sulfonamides can potentiate sulfonylureas (with consequent hypoglycemia), phenytoin (with increased adverse effects), and coumarin anticoagulants.
Sulfonamides include the following: Mafenide Sulfacetamide Sulfadiazine Sulfadoxine Sulfamethizole Sulfamethoxazole Sulfanilamide Sulfasalazine Sulfisoxazole Three sulfonamides, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethizole, and sulfasalazine, are available as single drugs for oral use.
Sulfamethoxazole is coformulated with trimethoprim (as TMP / SMX).
Sulfadoxine combined with pyrimethamine is available for oral use.
Sulfonamides available for topical use include silver sulfadiazine and mafenide burn cream, sulfanilamide vaginal cream and suppositories, and sulfacetamide ophthalmic.
Resistance Sulfonamide resistance is widespread, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all.
Pharmacokinetics Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally and, when applied to burns, topically.
Sulfonamides are distributed throughout the body.
Introduction to Gram-Negative Bacilli By Larry M Bush, MD, FACP, Charles E Schmidt College of Medicine, Florida Atlantic University; Maria T Vazquez-Pertejo, MD, FACP, Wellington Regional Medical Center Reviewed / Revised Apr 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Gram-negative bacilli are responsible for numerous diseases.
Some are commensal organisms present among normal intestinal flora.
These commensal organisms plus others from animal or environmental reservoirs may cause disease.
Urinary tract infections, diarrhea, peritonitis, and bloodstream infections are commonly caused by gram-negative bacilli.
Gram-negative bacteria cause plague, cholera, and typhoid fever.
These infections are rare in the US but are more common in areas of the world that have poor sanitation and / or an unsafe water and food supply.
These infections can be serious.
Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia Infections By Larry M Bush, MD, FACP, Charles E Schmidt College of Medicine, Florida Atlantic University; Maria T Vazquez-Pertejo, MD, FACP, Wellington Regional Medical Center Reviewed / Revised Apr 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Treatment The gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia are closely related normal intestinal flora that rarely cause disease in normal hosts.
Treatment Antibiotics based on results of susceptibility testing Treatment is with 3rd-generation cephalosporins, cefepime, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin / tazobactam, or aminoglycosides.
However, because some isolates are resistant to multiple antibiotics, susceptibility testing is essential.
Klebsiella strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) may develop resistance to cephalosporins during treatment, particularly with ceftazidime; these ESBL strains are inhibited to a variable extent by beta-lactamase inhibitors (eg, sulbactam, tazobactam, clavulanate, vaborbactam, avibactam).
Carbapenemase-producing species of K pneumoniae (KPC) have been isolated internationally as well as in the US, making treatment of some infections very problematic.
Ceftazidime / avibactam, imipenem / relebactam, and meropenem / vaborbactam (which include new beta-lactamase inhibitors that also inhibit KPC carbapenemases) as well as eravacycline and cefiderocol have activity against KPC isolates.
Enterobacter strains may become resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including 3rd-generation cephalosporins; the beta-lactamase enzyme they produce (AmpC beta-lactamase) is not inhibited by the usual beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, tazobactam, sulbactam).
However, these Enterobacter strains may be susceptible to carbapenems (eg, imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem).
Carbapenemase-resistant Enterobacterales have also been detected.
Infections with Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia are often hospital-acquired and occur mainly in patients with diminished resistance.
These three bacteria can cause a wide variety of infections, including bacteremia, surgical site infections, intravascular catheter infections, and respiratory or urinary tract infections that manifest as pneumonia, cystitis, or pyelonephritis and that may progress to lung abscess, empyema, bacteremia, and sepsis, as in the following: Klebsiella pneumonia, a rare and severe disease with dark brown or red currant-jelly sputum, lung abscess formation, and empyema, is most common among people with diabetes and people with an alcohol use disorder.
Serratia, particularly S marcescens, has greater affinity for the urinary tract.
Enterobacter most often cause nosocomial infections but can cause otitis media, cellulitis, and neonatal sepsis.
Diagnosis is by culture of blood and / or other infected tissue.
Susceptibility testing is also done.
Hepatitis B (HepB) Vaccine By Margot L Savoy, MD, MPH, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University Reviewed / Revised Oct 2022 View Patient Education Preparations Indications Contraindications and Precautions Dose and Administration Adverse Effects More Information The hepatitis B vaccine is 80 to 100% effective in preventing infection or clinical hepatitis B in people who complete the vaccine series.
Two single-antigen vaccines, Engerix-B and Recombivax HB, are conjugated with aluminum.
A newer formulation, HepB-CpG, uses the immune-stimulating adjuvant, cytidine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN).
A combination formulation that combines hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines (Twinrix) is available.
Indications for Hepatitis B Vaccine HepB vaccine is a routine childhood vaccination (see Table: Recommended Immunization Schedule for Ages 0 - 6 Years).
HepB vaccine also is indicated for all adults aged 19 through 59 years who have not been previously vaccinated.
HepB vaccine also is indicated for adults aged 60 years and older who have not been previously vaccinated and who have any of the following: A desire for protection from hepatitis B A sexually active lifestyle in people who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (eg, > 1 sex partner during the previous 6 months) Need for evaluation or treatment of a sexually transmitted infection Current or recent use of illicit injection drugs Sex between men Employment in which workers may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids (eg, health care, custodial, or public safety workers) Diabetes in people < 60 years (as soon as feasible after diagnosis) and sometimes in those ≥ 60 years (based on shared clinical decision-making between clinician and patient regarding the risk of becoming infected, having severe consequences if infected, and having an adequate immune response to vaccination) End-stage renal disease (eg, being treated with hemodialysis) HIV infection A chronic liver disorder (eg, people with hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level greater than twice the upper limit of normal) Household contact and / or sexual contact with people who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Travel to endemic areas Time spent (as patients, residents, or employees) in correctional facilities or in facilities that provide sexually transmitted infection treatment, HIV testing and treatment, drug abuse treatment and prevention services, services to injection-drug users or men who have sex with men, or care for patients with developmental disabilities or with end-stage renal disease (including those receiving long-term hemodialysis) The combination HepA and HepB vaccine can be used in people ≥ 18 years who have indications for either hepatitis A or hepatitis B vaccine and who have not been previously vaccinated with one of the vaccine components.
Contraindications and Precautions of Hepatitis B Vaccine The main contraindication for HepB vaccine is A severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after previous dose or to baker's yeast or any vaccine component The main precaution with HepB vaccine is Moderate or severe illness with or without a fever (vaccination is postponed until the illness resolves) Dose and Administration of Hepatitis B Vaccine The dose for Engerix-B and Recombivax HB is 0.5 mL IM up to age 20 years or 1 mL IM for adults (≥ 20 years).
The dose for HepB-CpG is 0.5 mL IM for adults ≥ 18 years.
The vaccine is typically given to children in a 3-dose series at age 0 months, at 1 to 2 months, and at 6 to 18 months.
Infants who did not receive a dose a birth should begin the series as soon as feasible.
For more information, see Hepatitis B Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Vaccine Recommendations and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Hepatitis B Vaccination.
All children not previously vaccinated with HepB vaccine should be vaccinated at age 11 or 12 years.
A 3-dose schedule is used; the first and second doses are separated by ≥ 4 weeks, and the third dose is given 4 to 6 months after the second dose.
However, a 2-dose schedule using Recombivax HB can be used; the second dose is given 4 to 6 months after the first.
Adults age 19 through 59 years who have not been previously vaccinated should complete a 2 - or 3 -, or 4-dose series.
The usual schedule for adults using Engerix-B or Recombivax HB is a 3-dose series with 2 doses separated by ≥ 4 weeks, and a third dose 4 to 6 months after the second dose.
HepB-CpG is given in 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and can be given as a substitute in a 3-dose series with a different HepB vaccine.
HepB-CpG should not be given during pregnancy because safety data are not available on its use during pregnancy.
Unvaccinated adults who are being treated with hemodialysis or who are immunocompromised should be given 2 doses of Engerix-B 20 mcg / mL given simultaneously in a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months.
If people are not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated, the missing doses should be given to complete the 3-dose HepB series.
The second dose is given 1 month after the first dose; the third dose is given ≥ 2 months after the second dose (and ≥ 4 months after the first dose).
If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is used, 3 doses are given at 0, 1, and 6 months, or 4 doses are given on days 0, 7, and 21 to 30, followed by a booster dose at 12 months.
If a person was lost to follow-up before the series was completed, the series does not need to be restarted.
Adverse Effects of Hepatitis B Vaccine Serious adverse effects are very rare and include anaphylaxis.
Mild effects include pain at the injection site and occasionally an increase in temperature to about 38° C More Information The following English-language resources may be useful.
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): Hepatitis B ACIP Vaccine Recommendations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Hepatitis B Vaccination: Information for Healthcare Providers Summary of changes to the 2022 adult immunization schedule
Preparations of Hepatitis B Vaccine Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine is produced using recombinant DNA technology.
A plasmid containing the gene for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is inserted into common baker's yeast, which then produces HBsAg.
This vaccine cannot cause hepatitis B virus infection because no potentially infectious viral DNA or complete viral particles are produced during this process.
Several vaccines are available.
Locked-In Syndrome By Kenneth Maiese, MD, Rutgers University Reviewed / Revised May 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Prognosis Treatment Locked-in syndrome is a state of wakefulness and awareness with quadriplegia and paralysis of the lower cranial nerves, resulting in inability to show facial expression, move, speak, or communicate, except by coded eye movements.
Because patients lack the motor responses (eg, withdrawal from painful stimuli) usually used to measure responsiveness, they may be mistakenly thought to be unconscious.
Thus, all patients who cannot move should have their comprehension tested by requesting eye blinking or vertical eye movements.
As in vegetative state, neuroimaging is indicated to rule out treatable disorders.
Brain imaging with CT or MRI is done and helps identify the pontine abnormality.
Positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), functional MRI, or evoked responses may be done to further assess cerebral function if the diagnosis is in doubt.
In patients with locked-in syndrome, electroencephalography (EEG) shows normal sleep-wake patterns.
Prognosis for Locked-In Syndrome Prognosis for patients with locked-in syndrome depends on the cause and the subsequent level of support provided.
For example, locked-in syndrome due to transient ischemia or a small stroke in the vertebrobasilar artery distribution may resolve completely.
When the cause (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) is partly reversible, recovery can occur over months but is seldom complete.
Favorable prognostic features include Early recovery of lateral eye movements Early recovery of evoked potentials in response to magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex Irreversible or progressive disorders (eg, cancers that involve the posterior fossa and the pons) are usually fatal.
Locked-in syndrome typically results from a stroke (pontine hemorrhage or infarct) that causes quadriplegia and disrupts and damages the lower cranial nerves and the centers that control horizontal gaze.
Treatment of Locked-In Syndrome Supportive care Communication training Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment for patients with locked-in syndrome and should include the following: Preventing systemic complications due to immobilization (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, thromboembolic disease) Providing good nutrition Preventing pressure ulcers Providing physical therapy to prevent limb contractures There is no specific treatment for locked-in syndrome.
Because cognitive function is intact and communication is possible, patients should make their own health care decisions.
Speech therapists may help establish a communication code using eye blinks or movements.
Some patients with locked-in syndrome communicate with each other via the Internet using a computer terminal controlled by eye movements and other means.
Other disorders that result in severe widespread motor paralysis (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) and cancers that involve the posterior fossa and the pons are less common causes.
Locked-in syndrome can also result from infection, tumors, toxins, trauma, arteriovenous malformations, and opioid use.
Symptoms and Signs of Locked-In Syndrome Patients with locked-in syndrome have intact cognitive function and are awake, with eye opening and normal sleep-wake cycles.
They can hear and see.
However, they cannot move their lower face, chew, swallow, speak, breathe, move their limbs, or move their eyes laterally.
Vertical eye movement is possible; patients can open and close their eyes or blink a specific number of times to answer questions.
Diagnosis of Locked-In Syndrome Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of locked-in syndrome is primarily clinical.
Overview of Intestinal Protozoan and Microsporidia Infections By Chelsea Marie, PhD, University of Virginia; William A Petri, Jr, MD, PhD, University of Virginia School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Jun 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Diagnosis Protozoa is a loose term for certain nucleated, unicellular organisms (eukaryotes) that lack a cell wall and are neither animals, plants, nor fungi.
Diagnosis Making a diagnosis of intestinal protozoan and microsporidia infections based on symptoms and physical findings is difficult; stool testing for parasite antigens or DNA and microscopic examination of stool for cysts or organisms are necessary.
Fecal antigen tests that are sensitive and specific are available for Cryptosporidium species E histolytica G duodenalis Microscopic diagnosis may require several samples, concentration methods, and special stains; thus, the laboratory should be notified which pathogen or pathogens are suspected.
Some patients require semi-invasive diagnostic techniques such as endoscopic biopsy (see table).
Molecular diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction-based assays is available for many enteric protozoa.
The most important intestinal protozoan pathogens that cause enteric infections in humans include Cryptosporidium species (see Cryptosporidiosis) Cyclospora cayetanensis (see Cyclosporiasis) Cystoisospora belli (previously known as Isospora belli —see Cystoisosporiasis) Entamoeba histolytica (see Amebiasis) Giardia duodenalis (previously known as G lamblia, G intestinalis —see Giardiasis) Members of the phylum Microsporidia used to be classified as protozoa but are now, based on DNA studies, thought to be fungi or closely related to them.
Multiple pathogenic parasites and nonpathogenic commensal organisms may be present in the intestine at the same time.
Intestinal protozoa are spread by the fecal-oral route, so infections are widespread in areas with inadequate sanitation and water treatment.
They are also common in the US in settings where fecal incontinence and poor hygiene prevail, as may occur in mental institutions and day care centers.
Occasionally, large foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of intestinal protozoan infection have occurred in the US (eg, the multi-state outbreak of Cyclospora cayetanensis infection attributed to contaminated fresh vegetable trays in 2018 and the massive waterborne Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993).
Some gastrointestinal protozoa are spread sexually, especially with practices involving oral-anal contact.
Several protozoan species cause severe opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS.
Systemic protozoal diseases are discussed elsewhere and include malaria, babesiosis, toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and African trypanosomiasis.
Anisakiasis (Herring Worm Disease; Cod Worm Disease; Seal Worm Disease) By Chelsea Marie, PhD, University of Virginia; William A Petri, Jr, MD, PhD, University of Virginia School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Key Points Topic Resources Anisakis Life Cycle Anisakiasis is infection with larvae of worms of the Anisakis simplex complex and the other anisakid species, Pseudoterranova decipiens complex and Contracecum osculatum complex.
Symptoms and Signs of Anisakiasis Symptoms of gastric anisakiasis typically include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting within hours of ingesting the larvae.
Involvement of the small intestine is less common and may result in an inflammatory mass and subacute symptoms resembling Crohn disease that develop 1 to 2 weeks later.
Ectopic infections outside the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may rarely occur.
Anisakiasis typically resolves spontaneously after several weeks; rarely, it persists for months.
Diagnosis of Anisakiasis Upper endoscopy Anisakiasis can be diagnosed by seeing the parasite during upper endoscopy, and patients may cough up larvae and bring them in for analysis.
Stool examination is unhelpful.
Serologic testing is available in some countries.
Treatment of Anisakiasis Endoscopic removal of the larvae Possibly albendazole Endoscopic removal of the larvae is curative.
Treatment of presumptive anisakiasis with albendazole 400 mg orally twice a day for 6 to 21 days may be effective, but data are limited.
Prevention of Anisakiasis Proper freezing conditions are key to preventing anisakiasis in sushi.
Infection is acquired by eating raw or poorly cooked saltwater fish or squid; larvae burrow into the mucosa of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, causing abdominal pain and sometimes vomiting.
Anisakis larvae are destroyed by Cooking to > 63° C (> 145° F) Freezing at −20° C (−4° F) or below for 7 days Freezing at −35° C (−31° F) or below until solid, then storing at that temperature for ≥ 15 hours, or at −20° C (−4° F) for 24 hours Larvae may resist pickling, salting, and smoking.
Key Points Humans acquire Anisakis when they consume the intermediate hosts (fish or squid) that are raw or undercooked; thus, anisakiasis is common in Japan and other cultures where raw fish is traditionally consumed.
Anisakiasis typically causes abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting within hours of ingesting the larvae; an inflammatory mass may form in the small intestine and symptoms may resemble Crohn disease.
Anisakiasis typically resolves spontaneously after several weeks.
Do upper endoscopy to diagnose anisakiasis.
Endoscopic removal of the larvae is curative.
Anisakis is a parasite that resides in the GI tract of marine mammals.
Excreted eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae, which are ingested by fish and squid; human infection is acquired by ingestion of these intermediate hosts in a raw or undercooked state.
Thus, infection is particularly common in locations such as Japan, Korea, and other areas where raw fish is traditionally consumed.
Larvae burrow into the stomach and small bowel of humans.
Commercial sushi prepared in the United States and elsewhere where fish is frozen under conditions that kill anisakid larvae is safe.
Toxoplasmosis By Chelsea Marie, PhD, University of Virginia; William A Petri, Jr, MD, PhD, University of Virginia School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Dec 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Key Points More Information Topic Resources Toxoplasma gondii... Retinitis (Toxoplasmosis) Interpretation of Toxoplasma Toxoplasmosis is infection with Toxoplasma gondii.
The risk of developing serious disease is very low except for a fetus infected in utero and people who are or become severely immunocompromised with AIDS or other diseases.
Acute infection should be suspected in immunocompromised patients if the IgG is positive.
However, IgG antibody levels in AIDS patients with Toxoplasma encephalitis are usually low to moderate, and IgG antibodies are sometimes absent; IgM antibodies are not present.
If the suspected diagnosis of CNS toxoplasmosis is correct, clinical and radiographic improvement should become evident within 7 to 14 days.
If symptoms worsen over the 1st week or do not lessen by the end of the 2nd week, a brain biopsy should be considered.
Ocular disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of the lesions in the eye, symptoms, course of disease, and results of serologic testing.
Treatment of Toxoplasmosis Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine plus leucovorin (to prevent bone marrow suppression); alternatively, the fixed drug combination trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole in some situations Clindamycin or atovaquone plus pyrimethamine when the patient is allergic to sulfonamides or does not tolerate sulfadiazine Treatment of toxoplasmosis is not indicated for immunocompetent patients who are asymptomatic or have mild, uncomplicated acute infection; treatment is required only when visceral disease is present or symptoms are severe or persist.
However, specific treatment is indicated for acute toxoplasmosis in the following: Neonates Pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis Immunocompromised patients Pearls & Pitfalls No treatment is required for immunocompetent patients who are asymptomatic or have mild, uncomplicated acute toxoplasmosis.
Treatment of immunocompetent patients The most effective regimen in immunocompetent patients with visceral involvement or severe or persistent symptoms is pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine, for 2 to 4 weeks.
Dosage is Pyrimethamine 50 mg twice a day for 2 days, then 25 to 50 mg once a day in adults (in children, 2 mg / kg orally on day 1, then 1 mg / kg once a day; maximum 25 mg / day) plus Sulfadiazine 1 g orally 4 times a day in adults (in children, 50 mg / kg twice a day) Folinic acid (leucovorin) is given concurrently to help protect against bone marrow suppression: adults 10 to 20 mg orally once a day (children 7.5 mg orally once a day) In patients who have or develop sulfonamide hypersensitivity, clindamycin 600 to 800 mg orally 3 times a day is given with pyrimethamine and leucovorin instead of sulfonamides.
Another option is atovaquone plus pyrimethamine and leucovorin.
Pathophysiology of Toxoplasmosis T gondii is ubiquitous in birds and mammals.
The fixed combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole has been used as an alternative as well as pyrimethamine and leucovorin plus clarithromycin, or dapsone, or azithromycin, but they have not been extensively studied.
Treatment of patients with AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions It is important to optimize antiretroviral therapy.
Higher doses of pyrimethamine are used in immunocompromised patients, most of whom have AIDS with CNS toxoplasmosis or, uncommonly, involvement of other organs.
A loading dose of pyrimethamine 200 mg orally is given the first day, then 50 mg once a day in patients < 60 kg and 75 mg once a day in those > 60 kg, plus sulfadiazine 1, 000 mg orally 4 times a day in patients < 60 kg and 1, 500 mg orally 4 times a day in patients > 60 kg for at least 6 weeks and 4 to 6 weeks after resolution of clinical signs and symptoms.
Pyrimethamine bone marrow suppression can be minimized with leucovorin (also called folinic acid—not folate, which blocks the therapeutic effect).
Dosage of leucovorin is 10 to 25 mg orally once a day (7.5 mg once a day in children).
Even when leucovorin is given, the complete blood count should be monitored weekly.
If pyrimethamine is not available, trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole, 5 mg / kg trimethoprim and 25 mg / kg sulfamethoxazole IV or orally twice a day is a potentially effective alternative, but pyrimethamine is more active than trimethoprim against the parasite's dihydrofolate reductase.
If patients cannot take sulfonamides, pyrimethamine and leucovorin plus clindamycin 600 mg 4 times a day can be used.
Atovaquone 1, 500 mg twice a day with or without pyrimethamine and leucovorin is another option.
This obligate intracellular parasite invades and multiplies asexually as tachyzoites within the cytoplasm of any nucleated cell (see figure).
Relapses are particularly common in AIDS patients with CD4 counts < 200 / mcL. Maintenance therapy is continued until the CD4 counts remain > 200 / mcL for > 6 months on antiretroviral therapy.
There are several options for maintenance therapy: Sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin Clindamycin, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin Atovaquone, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin Atovaquone and sulfadiazine Atovaquone Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine and leucovorin can be continued at lower doses than used for initial treatment: Sulfadiazine is given 1 g twice a day to 4 times a day with pyrimethamine 25 to 50 mg once a day and leucovorin 10 to 25 mg once a day.
An alternative for patients who do not tolerate sulfonamides is clindamycin 600 mg 3 times a day plus pyrimethamine 25 to 50 mg once a day plus leucovorin 10 to 25 mg once a day, but an additional agent is needed to prevent pneumonia.
If pyrimethamine is not available or not tolerated, trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole 1 double strength tablet twice a day can be used for maintenance.
Other options for chronic maintenance therapy include atovaquone 750 to 1, 500 mg twice a day with pyrimethamine 25 mg once a day plus leucovorin 10 mg once a day; atovaquone 750 to 1, 500 mg plus sulfadiazine 1 g twice a day to 4 times a day; or atovaquone alone 750 to 1, 500 mg twice a day.
The relapse rate may be higher with the atovaquone - based alternatives.
Treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis Treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis is based on results of a complete ophthalmologic evaluation (degree of inflammation; visual acuity; size, location, and persistence of lesion).
Doses are Pyrimethamine 100 mg day 1 as a single loading dose, then 25 to 50 mg orally once a day in adults (in children, 2 mg / kg on day 1, then 1 mg / kg once a day) plus Sulfadiazine 2 to 4 g orally day 1as a loading dose, then 500 mg to 1 g four times a day in adults (in children, 50 mg / kg twice a day) plus Folinic acid (leucovorin) 5 to 25 mg orally once a day with each dose of pyrimethamine as long as pyrimethamine is given in adults (in children, 7.5 mg once a day) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that therapy for ocular toxoplasmosis be continued for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by reevaluation of the patient's condition (see also CDC: Toxoplasmosis: Resources for Health Professionals).
When host immunity develops, multiplication of tachyzoites ceases and tissue cysts form; cysts persist in a dormant state for years, especially in brain, eyes, and muscle.
Patients with ocular toxoplasmosis are also frequently given corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.
Treatment of pregnant patients Treatment of pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis can decrease the incidence of fetal infection.
Spiramycin 1 g orally 3 or 4 times a day has been used safely to reduce transmission to the fetus in pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, but spiramycin is less active than pyrimethamine plus sulfonamide and does not cross the placenta.
Spiramycin is continued until fetal infection is documented or excluded at 18 weeks gestational age when amniotic fluid is obtained and tested using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - based assay.
If no transmission has occurred, spiramycin can be continued to term.
If the fetus is infected or a mother becomes infected after 18 weeks, pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine plus leucovorin is used.
Pyrimethamine is a potent teratogen and should not be used during the 1st and early 2nd trimester.
NOTE: Spiramycin is not commercially available in the US, but is available through the U S.Food and Drug Administration's Division of Anti-Infective Drug Products (phone: 301 - 796 - 1400).
Consultation with an infectious diseases expert is recommended.
Treatment of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis Infants with congenital toxoplasmosis should be treated with pyrimethamine plus a sulfonamide for 1 year (1).
The dormant Toxoplasma forms within the cysts are called bradyzoites.
Infants should also receive leucovorin while receiving pyrimethamine and for 1 week after pyrimethamine is stopped to prevent bone marrow suppression.
Recommendations from the National Reference Laboratory for Toxoplasmosis (PAMF-TSL) and the Toxoplasmosis Center at the University of Chicago for treatment of congenitally infected infants are Pyrimethamine 1 mg / kg orally twice a day for the first 2 days; then from day 3 to 2 months (or 6 months if symptomatic) 1 mg / kg once a day, then 1 mg / kg 3 times per week to complete 12 months of therapy plus Sulfadiazine 50 mg / kg twice a day plus Folinic acid (leucovorin) 10 mg 3 times a week Treatment reference 1.
Pediatrics 139 (2): e20163860, 2017. doi: 10.1542 / peds.2016 - 3860 Prevention of Toxoplasmosis Washing hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, soil, or cat litter is essential to help prevent toxoplasmosis.
Food possibly contaminated with cat feces should be avoided.
Meat should be cooked to 165 to 170° F (73.9 to 76.7° C).
If contact is unavoidable, pregnant women should at least avoid cleaning cat litter boxes or wear gloves when doing so.
Gloves should also be worn while gardening to avoid contact with soil.
Primary chemoprophylaxis is recommended for patients with HIV and a positive IgG T gondii serologic test once CD4 cell counts are < 100 / mcL.
Sexual reproduction of T gondii occurs only in the intestinal tract of cats; the resultant oocysts passed in the feces remain infectious in moist soil for months.
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole one double-strength tablet once a day, which also is prophylactic against Pneumocystis jirovecii, is typically used.
If this dosage is not tolerated, alternatives are one double-strength tablet 3 times a week or one single-strength tablet once a day.
Alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole at all include dapsone 50 mg once a day plus pyrimethamine 50 mg once a week and leucovorin 25 mg once a week; or dapsone 200 mg once a week plus pyrimethamine 75 mg once a week plus leucovorin 25 mg once a week.
Chemoprophylaxis is continued until the CD4 cell count is > 200 / mcL.
Key Points T gondii reproduces sexually in the intestinal tract of cats; most human infections result from direct or indirect contact with cat feces but can be acquired transplacentally or by ingestion of poorly cooked meat that contains cysts.
About 11% of the US population have been infected with T gondii, but symptomatic disease is rare and occurs mainly in fetuses who are infected when the mother acquires acute infection during pregnancy and transmits the infection transplacentally or in people who are immunocompromised by HIV or other causes.
Acute infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but 10 to 20% have manifestations, similar to those of mononucleosis, including lymphadenopathy.
Immunocompromised patients typically present with encephalitis and have ring-enhancing intracranial mass lesions, seen on MRI or CT with contrast.
To diagnose, use serologic tests (for IgG and IgM antibodies), histopathology, or polymerase chain reaction.
Treatment is indicated mainly for congenitally infected neonates, pregnant women with acute infection, and immunocompromised patients.
Toxoplasma gondii life cycle The only known definitive hosts for T gondii are members of family Felidae (domestic cats and their relatives).
Use pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine plus leucovorin or, if the patient is allergic to sulfonamides or sulfadiazine is not tolerated, pyrimethamine and clindamycin.
Pyrimethamine is a potent teratogen and should not be used during the 1st and early 2nd trimester of pregnancy; spiramycin is recommended then for maternal infection.
Antiretroviral therapy should be optimized in patients with AIDS; suppressive treatment is continued until patients are asymptomatic and CD4 cell counts are > 200 / mcL for > 6 months.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Resources for Health Professionals: Toxoplasmosis AIDSinfo: Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents
Oocysts are shed in the cat's feces.
Large numbers are shed, but usually only for 1 - 2 weeks.
Symptoms range from none to benign lymphadenopathy, a mononucleosis-like illness, to life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) disease or involvement of other organs in immunocompromised people.
Oocysts take 1 - 5 days to sporulate and become infective.
Cats become reinfected by ingesting sporulated oocysts.
Soil, water, plant material, or cat litter becomes contaminated with oocysts.
Intermediate hosts in nature (eg, birds, rodents, wild game, animals bred for human consumption) become infected after ingesting infective materials.
Oocysts develop into tachyzoites shortly after ingestion.
Tachyzoites spread throughout the body and form tissue cysts in neural, eye, and muscle tissue.
Cats become infected after consuming intermediate hosts containing tissue cysts.
Humans can become infected by ingesting undercooked meat containing tissue cysts.
Humans can become infected by ingesting food or water contaminated with cat feces or other feces-contaminated materials (eg, soil) or contact with a pet cat's litter.
Rarely, human infection results from blood transfusion or organ transplantation.
Rarely, transplacental transmission from mother to fetus occurs.
Retinochoroiditis, seizures, and intellectual disability occur in congenital infection.
In the human host, parasites form tissue cysts, most commonly in skeletal muscle, myocardium, the brain, and the eyes; these cysts may remain throughout the life of the host and can reactivate if the host becomes immunocompromised.
Infection can occur by Ingestion of oocysts Ingestion of tissue cysts Transplacental transmission Blood transfusion or organ transplantation Ingestion of oocysts in food or water contaminated with cat feces is the most common mode of oral infection.
Infection can also occur by eating raw or undercooked meat containing tissue cysts, most commonly lamb, pork, or rarely beef.
After ingestion of oocysts or tissue cysts, tachyzoites are released and spread throughout the body.
This acute infection is followed by the development of protective immune responses and the formation of tissue cysts in many organs.
The cysts can reactivate causing disease, primarily in immunocompromised patients.
Toxoplasmosis reactivates in 30 to 40% of AIDS patients who are not taking antibiotic prophylaxis, but the widespread use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis prophylaxis has dramatically reduced the incidence.
Toxoplasmosis can be transmitted transplacentally if the mother becomes infected during pregnancy or if immunosuppression reactivates a prior infection.
Transmission of Toxoplasma to a fetus is extraordinarily rare in immunocompetent mothers who were infected with Toxoplasma and developed immunity prior to pregnancy.
Diagnosis is by serologic tests, histopathology, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Transmission may occur via transfusion of whole blood or white blood cells or via transplantation of an organ from a seropositive donor.
In otherwise healthy people, congenital or acquired infection can reactivate in the eyes.
Nonocular reactivation is very rare in healthy people.
Past infection confers resistance to reinfection.
Symptoms and Signs of Toxoplasmosis Infections may manifest in several ways: Acute toxoplasmosis Central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis Congenital toxoplasmosis Ocular toxoplasmosis Disseminated or non-CNS disease in immunocompromised patients Acute toxoplasmosis Acute infection is usually asymptomatic, but 10 to 20% of patients develop bilateral, nontender cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
A few of these also have a mild flu-like syndrome of fever, malaise, myalgia, hepatosplenomegaly, and less commonly, pharyngitis, which can mimic infectious mononucleosis and include lymphadenitis.
Atypical lymphocytosis, mild anemia, leukopenia, and slightly elevated liver enzymes are common.
The syndrome may persist for weeks but is almost always self-limited.
CNS toxoplasmosis Most patients with AIDS or other immunocompromised patients who develop toxoplasmosis present with encephalitis and ring-enhancing intracranial mass lesions seen on CT or MRI scans, both with contrast.
Risk is greatest among those with CD4 counts of < 50 / mcL; toxoplasmic encephalitis is rare when CD4 counts are > 200 / mcL.
Treatment is most often with pyrimethamine plus either sulfadiazine or clindamycin.
These patients typically have headache, altered mental status, seizures, coma, fever, and sometimes focal neurologic deficits, such as motor or sensory loss, cranial nerve palsies, visual abnormalities, and focal seizures.
Congenital toxoplasmosis Congenital toxoplasmosis results from a primary, often asymptomatic infection acquired by the mother during pregnancy.
Women infected before conception ordinarily do not transmit toxoplasmosis to the fetus unless the infection is reactivated during pregnancy by immunosuppression.
Spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or birth defects may occur.
The percentage of surviving fetuses born with toxoplasmosis depends on when maternal infection is acquired; it increases from 15% during the 1st trimester to 30% during the 2nd to 60% during the 3rd.
The severity of congenital diseases decreases if the mother becomes infected later in pregnancy.
Disease in neonates may be severe, particularly if acquired early in pregnancy; symptoms include jaundice, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and the characteristic tetrad of abnormalities: Bilateral retinochoroiditis Cerebral calcifications Hydrocephalus or microcephaly Psychomotor retardation Prognosis is poor.
Many children with less severe infections and most infants born to mothers infected during the 3rd trimester appear healthy at birth but are at high risk of seizures, intellectual disability, retinochoroiditis, or other symptoms developing months or even years later.
Ocular toxoplasmosis This type usually results from congenital infection that is reactivated, often during the teens and 20s, but rarely, it occurs with acquired infections.
Focal necrotizing retinitis and a secondary granulomatous inflammation of the choroid occur and may cause ocular pain, blurred vision, and sometimes blindness.
Relapses are common.
Disseminated infection and non-CNS involvement Disease outside the eye and CNS is much less common and occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised patients.
They may present with pneumonitis, myocarditis, polymyositis, diffuse maculopapular rash, high fevers, chills, and prostration.
In toxoplasmic pneumonitis, diffuse interstitial infiltrates may progress rapidly to consolidation and cause respiratory failure, whereas endarteritis may lead to infarction of small lung segments.
Untreated disseminated infections are usually fatal.
Diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis Serologic testing For central nervous system involvement, CT or MRI and lumbar puncture Histopathologic evaluation of biopsies Polymerase chain reaction-based assays of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue, or, during pregnancy, amniotic fluid Toxoplasmosis is usually diagnosed serologically using an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for IgG and IgM antibodies (see table).
Specific IgM antibodies appear during the first 2 weeks of acute illness, peak within 4 to 8 weeks, and eventually become undetectable, but they may be present for as long as 18 months after acute infection.
IgG antibodies arise more slowly, peak in 1 to 2 months, and may remain high and stable for months to years.
Assays for Toxoplasma IgM lack specificity.
Human exposure to toxoplasmosis is common wherever cats are found.
Table The diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis during pregnancy and in the fetus or neonate can be difficult, and consultation with an expert is recommended.
If the patient is pregnant and IgG and IgM are positive, an IgG avidity test should be done.
High avidity antibodies in the first 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy essentially rules out an infection acquired during gestation.
But a low IgG avidity result cannot be interpreted as indicating recent infection because some patients have persistent low IgG avidity for many months after infection.
Suspected recent infection in a pregnant woman should be confirmed before intervention by having samples tested at a toxoplasmosis reference laboratory.
If the patient has clinical illness compatible with toxoplasmosis but the IgG titer is low, a follow-up titer 2 to 3 weeks later should show an increase in antibody titer if the illness is due to acute toxoplasmosis, unless the host is severely immunocompromised.
In general, detection of specific IgM antibody in neonates suggests congenital infection.
Maternal IgG crosses the placenta, but IgM does not.
Detection of Toxoplasma - specific IgA antibodies is more sensitive than IgM in congenitally infected infants, but it is available only at special reference facilities (eg, Toxoplasma Serology Laboratory, Palo Alto Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA).
An expert should be consulted when fetal or congenital infection is suspected.
An estimated 11% of residents ≥ 6 years in the US are seropositive, which indicates that they have been infected, and more than 60% of some populations in other regions have been infected (see Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Epidemiology & Risk Factors).
Toxoplasma are occasionally demonstrated histologically.
Tachyzoites, which are present during acute infection, take up Giemsa or Wright stain but may be difficult to find in routine tissue sections.
Tissue cysts do not distinguish acute from chronic infection.
Toxoplasma must be distinguished from other intracellular organisms, such as Histoplasma, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for parasite DNA in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or amniotic fluid are available at several reference laboratories.
PCR-based analysis of amniotic fluid is the preferred method to diagnose toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.
If central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis is suspected, patients should have head CT with contrast or MRI with contrast, or both plus a lumbar puncture if there are no signs of increased intracranial pressure.
Although these lesions are not pathognomonic, their presence in patients with AIDS and CNS symptoms warrants a trial of chemotherapy for T gondii.
CSF may be positive for lymphocytic pleocytosis, and the protein level may be elevated.
Approach to the Neurologic Patient By Michael C Levin, MD, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan Reviewed / Revised Jul 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education History Physical Examination and Testing Patients with neurologic symptoms are approached in a stepwise manner termed the neurologic method, which consists of the following: Identifying the anatomic location of the lesion or lesions causing symptoms Identifying the pathophysiology involved Generating a differential diagnosis Selecting specific, appropriate tests Identifying the anatomy and pathophysiology of the lesion through careful history taking and an accurate neurologic examination markedly narrows the differential diagnosis and thus the number of tests needed.
Usually, a clinician can quickly determine whether a reliable history is forthcoming or whether a family member should be interviewed instead.
History of present illness should include the following: Specific questions clarify the quality, intensity, distribution, duration, and frequency of each symptom.
What aggravates and attenuates the symptom and whether past treatment was effective should be determined.
Asking the patient to describe the order in which symptoms occur can help identify the cause.
Specific disabilities should be described quantitatively (eg, walks at most 25 feet before stopping to rest), and their effect on the patient's daily routine noted.
Past medical history and a complete review of systems are essential because neurologic complications are common in other disorders, especially alcoholism, diabetes, cancer, vascular disorders, and HIV infection.
Family history is important because migraine and many metabolic, muscle, nerve, and neurodegenerative disorders are inherited.
Social, occupational, and travel history provides information about unusual infections and exposure to toxins and parasites.
Sometimes neurologic symptoms and signs are functional or hysterical, reflecting a psychiatric disorder.
Typically, such symptoms and signs do not conform to the rules of anatomy and physiology, and the patient is often depressed or unusually frightened.
This approach should not be replaced by reflex ordering of CT, MRI, and other laboratory testing; doing so leads to error and unnecessary cost.
However, functional and physical disorders sometimes coexist, and distinguishing them can be challenging.
Physical Examination and Testing A physical examination to evaluate all body systems is done, but the focus is on the nervous system (neurologic examination).
The neurologic examination, discussed in detail elsewhere in T he M anual, includes the following: Mental status Cranial nerves Motor system Muscle strength Gait, stance, and coordination Sensation Reflexes Autonomic nervous system In many situations, a cerebrovascular examination also is done.
Diagnostic tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis or exclude other possible disorders.
To identify the anatomic location, the examiner considers questions such as Is the lesion in one or multiple locations?
Is the lesion confined to the nervous system, or is it part of a systemic disorder?
What part of the nervous system is affected?
Specific parts of the nervous system to be considered include the cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord, brachial or lumbosacral plexus, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and muscle.
Once the location of the lesion is identified, categories of pathophysiologic causes are considered; they include Vascular Infectious Neoplastic Degenerative Traumatic Toxic-metabolic Immune-mediated When appropriately applied, the neurologic method provides an orderly approach to even the most complex case, and clinicians are far less likely to be fooled by neurologic mimicry—eg, when symptoms of an acute stroke are actually due to a brain tumor or when rapidly ascending paralysis suggesting Guillain-Barré syndrome is actually due to spinal cord compression.
History The history is the most important part of the neurologic evaluation.
Patients should be put at ease and allowed to tell their story in their own words.
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (Benign Positional Vertigo; Benign Postural Vertigo; BPPV) By Mickie Hamiter, MD, New York Presbyterian Columbia Reviewed / Revised May 2023 View Patient Education Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Inside the Ear Epley maneuver: A Simple... In benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, short (< 60 seconds) episodes of vertigo occur with certain head positions.
This displaced material stimulates hair cells most commonly in the posterior semicircular canal, occasionally in the lateral semicircular canal, and rarely in the superior semicircular canal, creating the illusion of motion.
Etiologic factors include Spontaneous degeneration of the utricular otolithic membranes Labyrinthine concussion Otitis media Ear surgery Recent viral infection (eg, viral neuronitis) Head trauma Prolonged anesthesia or bed rest Previous vestibular disorders (eg, Meniere disease) Occlusion of the anterior vestibular artery Inside the Ear Symptoms and Signs of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Vertigo is triggered when the patient's head moves (eg, when rolling over in bed or bending over to pick up something).
Acute paroxysms of vertigo last only a few seconds to minutes; episodes tend to peak in the morning and abate throughout the day.
Nausea and vomiting may occur, but hearing loss and tinnitus do not.
Diagnosis of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Clinical evaluation Gadolinium-enhanced MRI if findings suggest central nervous system (CNS) lesion The diagnosis of BPPV is based on characteristic symptoms, nystagmus elicited by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (also called the Barany maneuver), and the absence of other abnormalities noted during neurologic examination.
Such patients require no further testing.
Unlike the positional nystagmus caused by BPPV, positional nystagmus caused by a CNS lesion has the following characteristics: Lacks latency, fatigability, and severe subjective sensation May continue for as long as the position is maintained May be vertical or change direction If rotary, is likely to be in an unexpected direction If patients have nystagmus suggesting a CNS lesion, gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and internal auditory canal is performed.
Treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Provocative maneuvers to fatigue symptoms Canalith repositioning maneuvers BPPV usually subsides spontaneously in several weeks or months but may continue for months or years.
Because brief episodes can recur over a long period of time, medications (such as those used in Meniere disease) are not recommended.
Often, the adverse effects of medications worsen dysequilibrium.
Nausea and nystagmus develop.
Because BPPV is fatigable, one therapeutic approach is to have the patient perform provocative maneuvers early in the day in a safe environment.
Symptoms are then minimal for the rest of the day.
Canalith repositioning maneuvers (most commonly the Epley maneuver or, less commonly, the Semont, maneuver or Brandt-Daroff exercises) involve moving the head through a series of specific positions intended to return the errant canalith to the utricle.
After the Epley or Semont maneuver is done, the patient should try to avoid neck flexion or extension for 1 to 2 days.
These maneuvers can be repeated as necessary.
The Brandt-Daroff exercises are done 5 times in a row, 3 times / day, for about 2 weeks or until there is no vertigo with the exercise.
For the Semont maneuver, the patient is seated upright in the middle of an examination table.
The patient's head is rotated toward the unaffected ear; this rotation is maintained throughout the maneuver.
Next, the torso is lowered laterally onto the examination table so that the patient is lying on the side of the affected ear with the nose pointed up.
After 3 minutes in this position, the patient is quickly moved through the upright position without straightening the head and is lowered laterally to the other side now with the nose pointed down.
After 3 minutes in this position, the patient is slowly returned to the upright position, and the head is rotated back to normal.
The patient sits upright, then lies on one side with the nose pointed up at a 45-degree angle.
The patient remains in this position for about 30 seconds or until the vertigo subsides and then moves back to the seated position.
The same motion is repeated on the opposite side.
This cycle is repeated 5 times in a row, 3 times / day, for about 2 weeks, or until there is no more vertigo with the exercise.
Key Points In BPPV, vertigo is caused by displacement of otoconial crystals into a semicircular canal; symptoms are triggered by head movement.
Nausea and vomiting may also occur, but not tinnitus or hearing loss.
Treatment involves canalith repositioning maneuvers.
Diagnosis is clinical, but some patients require MRI to rule out other conditions.
Treat with canalith-repositioning maneuvers.
Medications rarely help and may worsen symptoms.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of relapsing otogenic vertigo.
It affects people increasingly as they age and can severely affect balance in older adults, leading to potentially injurious falls.
Etiology of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo BPPV is thought to be caused by displacement of otoconial crystals (calcium carbonate crystals normally embedded in the saccule and utricle).
Goodpasture Syndrome (Goodpasture's Syndrome; Anti-GBM Antibody Disease) By Joyce Lee, MD, MAS, University of Colorado School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Sep 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Prognosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Alveolar Hemorrhage (Goodpasture... Goodpasture syndrome, a subtype of pulmonary-renal syndrome, is an autoimmune syndrome consisting of alveolar hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis caused by circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies.
Men are affected more often than women.
Anti-GBM antibodies are directed against the noncollagenous (NC-1) domain of the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen, which occurs in highest concentration in the basement membranes of renal and pulmonary capillaries.
Environmental exposures—cigarette smoking most commonly, and viral respiratory infection and hydrocarbon solvent inhalation less commonly—expose alveolar capillary antigens to circulating antibody in genetically susceptible people, most notably those with HLA-DRw15, - DR4, and - DRB1 alleles.
Circulating anti-GBM antibodies bind to basement membranes, fix complement, and trigger a cell-mediated inflammatory response, causing glomerulonephritis, pulmonary capillaritis, or both.
Symptoms and Signs of Goodpasture Syndrome Hemoptysis is the most prominent symptom; however, hemoptysis may not occur in patients with alveolar hemorrhage, and patients may present with only chest x-ray infiltrates or with infiltrates and respiratory distress, respiratory failure, or both.
Other common symptoms include Cough Dyspnea Fatigue Fever Hematuria Weight loss Up to 40% of patients have gross hematuria, although pulmonary hemorrhage may precede renal manifestations by weeks to years.
Signs vary over time and range from clear lungs on auscultation to crackles and rhonchi.
Some patients have peripheral edema due to renal failure and pallor due to anemia.
Diagnosis of Goodpasture Syndrome Serum anti-GBM antibody tests Sometimes renal biopsy Patients are tested for serum anti-GBM antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence testing or, when available, direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant or human NC-1 alpha3.
Presence of these antibodies confirms the diagnosis.
Goodpasture syndrome most often develops in genetically susceptible people who smoke cigarettes, but hydrocarbon inhalation exposure and viral respiratory infections are additional possible triggers.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) testing is positive (in a peripheral pattern) in only 25% of patients with Goodpasture syndrome.
If anti-GBM antibodies are absent and patients have evidence of glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria, red cell casts detected with urinalysis, renal insufficiency, or a combination of these findings), renal biopsy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis.
A rapidly progressive focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation is found in biopsy specimens in patients with Goodpasture syndrome and all other causes of pulmonary-renal syndrome.
Immunofluorescence staining of renal or lung tissue classically shows linear IgG deposition along the glomerular or alveolar capillaries.
IgG deposition also occurs in the kidneys of patients with diabetes or with fibrillary glomerulonephritis (a rare disorder causing the pulmonary-renal syndrome), but glomerular basement membrane binding of antibodies in these disorders is nonspecific and does not occur in linear patterns.
Prognosis of Goodpasture Syndrome Goodpasture syndrome is often rapidly progressive and can be fatal if prompt recognition and treatment are delayed.
Prognosis is good when treatment begins before onset of respiratory or renal failure.
Long-term morbidity is related to the degree of renal impairment at diagnosis.
Patients requiring urgent dialysis and those with > 50% crescents in the biopsy specimen (who often will require dialysis) usually survive for < 2 years unless kidney transplantation is done.
Hemoptysis may be a good prognostic sign because it leads to earlier detection; the minority of patients who are ANCA-positive respond better to treatment.
Symptoms are dyspnea, cough, fatigue, hemoptysis, and hematuria.
Relapse occurs in a small number and is linked to continued tobacco use and respiratory infection.
In patients with end-stage renal disease who receive kidney transplantation, disease can recur in the graft.
Treatment of Goodpasture Syndrome Plasma exchange Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide Immediate survival in patients with pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory failure is linked to airway control; endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are recommended for patients with borderline arterial blood gas measurements (ABGs) and impending respiratory failure.
Patients with significant renal impairment may require dialysis or kidney transplantation.
Treatment is daily or every-other-day plasma exchange for 2 to 3 weeks using 4-L exchanges to remove anti-GBM antibodies, combined with corticosteroids (usually methylprednisolone 1 g IV over 20 minutes once a day or every other day for 3 doses followed by prednisone (1 mg / kg orally once a day for 3 weeks, then titrated down to 20 mg orally once a day for 6 to 12 months) and cyclophosphamide (2 mg / kg orally or IV once a day for 6 to 12 months) to prevent formation of new antibodies.
Therapy can be tapered when pulmonary and renal function stop improving.
Rituximab could be used in some patients who have severe adverse effects due to cyclophosphamide or refuse cyclophosphamide as treatment, but it has not been studied in patients with Goodpasture syndrome.
Key Points Patients with Goodpasture syndrome may have both pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis or either one separately.
Pulmonary findings can be mild or nonspecific.
Test serum for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies.
Goodpasture syndrome is suspected in patients with hemoptysis or hematuria and is confirmed by the presence of anti-GBM antibodies in the blood or in a renal biopsy specimen.
Do a renal biopsy if patients have glomerulonephritis.
Diagnose and treat Goodpasture syndrome before organ failure develops whenever possible.
Treat using plasma exchange, a corticosteroid, and cyclophosphamide.
Prognosis is good when treatment is begun before onset of respiratory or renal failure.
Treatment includes plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide.
(See also Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome.)
Pathophysiology of Goodpasture Syndrome Goodpasture syndrome is the combination of glomerulonephritis with alveolar hemorrhage and anti-GBM antibodies.
Goodpasture syndrome most often manifests as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis together but can occasionally cause glomerulonephritis (10 to 20%) or pulmonary disease (10%) alone.
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome) By Hector A Gonzalez-Usigli, MD, HE UMAE Centro Médico Nacional de Occidente Reviewed / Revised Feb 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare, degenerative central nervous system disorder that progressively impairs voluntary eye movements and causes bradykinesia, muscular rigidity with progressive axial dystonia, pseudobulbar palsy, and dementia.
Patients tend to fall backward.
Dysphagia, dysarthria with emotional lability (pseudobulbar palsy), depression, and disordered sleep are common.
Resting tremor may develop.
Dementia eventually occurs.
Many patients become incapacitated within about 5 years and die within about 10 years.
Progressive supranuclear palsy has several different clinical types based on the predominant symptoms or signs (1): Richardson syndrome: Classic progressive supranuclear palsy with progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia and severe balance problems (the most common form, in ≥ 70% of cases) PSP-P: Parkinsonian type of progressive supranuclear palsy, which responds to levodopa, resulting in transient, slight improvement PSP-PAFG: Characterized by pure akinesia with freezing of gait PSP-PGF: Characterized by progressive gait freezing PSP-PNFA (PSP-SL): Characterized by progressive nonfluent aphasia or speech or language disorders PSP-AOS: Characterized by apraxia of speech PSP-FTLD (PSP-F): Characterized by frontotemporal degeneration PSP-CBS: Characterized by corticobasal syndrome, causing profound asymmetric symptoms PSP-MN (PSP-PLS): Characterized by motoneuron symptoms related to primary lateral sclerosis Other possible forms include PSP-C: Characterized by cerebellar signs PSP-PI: Characterized by postural instability In forms other than Richardson syndrome (nonclassical forms [called atypical parkinsonism]), ophthalmoplegia may be delayed by years.
The different clinical types of progressive supranuclear palsy have different characteristics (eg, parkinsonian features, corticobasal syndrome, speech problems, frontotemporal degenerative signs, akinesia, freezing of gait).
Diagnosis of PSP Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy is clinical.
MRI is usually done to exclude other disorders.
In advanced cases, MRI shows a characteristic decrease in midbrain size that is best seen on midsagittal views and that causes the midbrain to be shaped like a hummingbird or emperor penguin.
On axial views, the midbrain may resemble a morning glory (2).
Occasionally, levodopa and / or amantadine partially relieve rigidity.
Physical and occupational therapy may help improve mobility and function and reduce the risk of falls.
Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.
Because PSP is fatal, patients should be encouraged to prepare advance directives soon after the disorder is diagnosed.
These directives should indicate what kind of medical care people want at the end of life.
Key Points The first symptom of classic progressive supranuclear palsy may be difficulty looking up or down without moving the neck or difficulty climbing up and down stairs.
Focus on relieving symptoms; consider levodopa and / or amantadine to relieve rigidity, and prescribe physical and occupational therapy.
The cause of progressive supranuclear palsy is unknown.
Neurons in the basal ganglia and brain stem degenerate; neurofibrillary tangles containing an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein are also present.
Symptoms and Signs of PSP Symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy usually begin in late middle age.
The first symptom may be Difficulty looking up or down without moving the neck or difficulty climbing up and down stairs Voluntary eye movements, particularly downward gaze, become difficult, but vertical reflex eye movements triggered by passive head movement (neck flexion, extension) are unaffected.
Movements are slowed, muscles become rigid, and axial dystonia develops.
Pathophysiology of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Most commonly, bacteria reach the subarachnoid space and meninges via hematogenous spread.
When stopped, the PCO2 should be gradually increased to normal because a sudden increase may cause a significant increase in ICP.
Usually, adults are given mannitol 1 g / kg IV bolus over 30 minutes, repeated as needed every 3 to 4 hours or 0.25 g / kg every 2 to 3 hours, and children are given 0.5 to 2.0 g / kg over 30 minutes, repeated as needed.
Additional measures can include IV fluids Antiseizure drugs Treatment of concomitant infections Treatment of specific complications (eg, corticosteroids for Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, surgical drainage for subdural empyema) Prevention of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Use of vaccines for H influenzae type B and, to a lesser extent, for N meningitidis and S pneumoniae has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis.
Physical measures Keeping patients in respiratory isolation (using droplet precautions) for the first 24 hours of therapy can help prevent meningitis from spreading.
A conjugatedpneumococcal vaccine effective against 13 serotypes, including > 80% of organisms that cause meningitis, is recommended for all children (see table).
Routine vaccination against H influenzae type b is highly effective and begins at age 2 months.
A quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is given to Children who are 2 to 10 years if they have an immunodeficiency or functional asplenia All children at age 11 to 12 years with a booster dose at age 16 Older children, college students living in dormitories, and military recruits who have not had the vaccine previously Travelers to or residents of endemic areas Laboratory personnel who routinely handle meningococcal specimens During a meningitis epidemic, the population at risk (eg, college students, a small town) must be identified, and its size must be determined before proceeding to mass vaccination.
The effort is expensive and requires public education and support, but it saves lives and reduces morbidity.
Bacteria may also reach the meninges from nearby infected structures or through a congenital or acquired defect in the skull or spine (see Route of entry).
The meningococcal vaccine does not protect against serotype B meningococcal meningitis; this information should kept in mind when a vaccinated patient presents with symptoms of meningitis.
Chemoprophylaxis Anyone who has prolonged face-to-face contact with a patient who has meningitis (eg, household or day care contacts, medical personnel and other people who are exposed to the patient's oral secretions) should be given postexposure chemoprophylaxis.
For meningococcal meningitis, chemoprophylaxis consists of one of the following: Rifampin 600 mg (for children > 1 month, 10 mg / kg; for children < 1 month, 5 mg / kg) orally every 12 hours for 4 doses Ceftriaxone 250 mg (for children < 15 years, 125 mg) IM for 1 dose For adults, a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin 500 mg or ofloxacin 400 mg) orally for 1 dose For meningitis due to H influenzae type b, chemoprophylaxis is rifampin 20 mg / kg orally once a day (maximum: 600 mg / day) for 4 days.
There is no consensus on whether children < 2 years require prophylaxis for exposure at day care.
Chemoprophylaxis is not usually needed for contacts of patients with other types of bacterial meningitis.
Key Points Common causes of acute bacterial meningitis include N meningitidis and S pneumoniae in children and adults and Listeria species in infants and older adults; S aureus occasionally causes meningitis in people of all ages.
Typical features may be absent or subtle in infants, patients with alcohol use disorder, older patients, immunocompromised patients, and patients who develop meningitis after a neurosurgical procedure.
If patients have focal neurologic deficits, obtundation, seizures, or papilledema (suggesting increased ICP or an intracranial mass effect), defer lumbar puncture pending results of neuroimaging.
Treat acute bacterial meningitis as soon as possible, even before the diagnosis is confirmed.
Common empirically chosen antibiotic regimens often include 3rd-generation cephalosporins (for S pneumoniae and N meningitidis), ampicillin (for L monocytogenes), and vancomycin (for penicillin-resistant strains of S pneumoniae and for S aureus).
Because white blood cells (WBCs), immunoglobulins, and complement are normally sparse or absent from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bacteria initially multiply without causing inflammation.
Routine vaccination for H influenza, S pneumoniae, and N meningitidis and chemoprophylaxis against N meningitidis help prevent meningitis.
Practice Guidelines for the Management of Bacterial Meningitis: This article reviews the recommendations for the diagnosis and management of bacterial meningitis, including the initial approach, indications for CT before lumbar puncture, tests to distinguish viral from bacterial meningitis, specific tests to identify the causative bacteria, timing of antimicrobial drugs for suspected meningitis, specific drugs to be used to treat suspected or confirmed bacterial meningitis, and the role of dexamethasone.
2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's Clinical Practice Guidelines for Healthcare-Associated Ventriculitis and Meningitis: This article reviews the literature, evaluates the evidence, and presents recommendations.
It specifically discusses the approach to infections associated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts, cerebrospinal fluid drains, intrathecal drugs (eg, baclofen), deep brain stimulation hardware, neurosurgery, and head trauma.
Later, bacteria release endotoxins, teichoic acid, and other substances that trigger an inflammatory response with mediators such as WBCs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
Typically in CSF, levels of protein increase, and because bacteria consume glucose and because less glucose is transported into the CSF, glucose levels decrease.
Brain parenchyma is typically affected in acute bacterial meningitis.
Inflammation in the subarachnoid space is accompanied by cortical encephalitis and ventriculitis.
Complications of bacterial meningitis are common and may include Hydrocephalus (in some patients) Arterial or venous infarcts due to inflammation and thrombosis of arteries and veins in superficial and sometimes deep areas of brain Abducens palsy due to compression or inflammation of the 6th cranial nerve Deafness due to inflammation of the 8th cranial nerve or structures in the middle ear Subdural empyema Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema Brain abscess (if the infection penetrates into brain parenchyma) Brain herniation (the most common cause of death during the acute stages) Systemic complications (which are sometimes fatal), such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Etiology of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Likely causes of bacterial meningitis depend on Patient age Route of entry Immune status of the patient Age In neonates and young infants, the most common causes of bacterial meningitis are Group B streptococci, particularly Streptococcus agalactiae Escherichia (E) coli and other gram-negative bacteria Listeria monocytogenes In older infants, children, and young adults, the most common causes of bacterial meningitis are Neisseria meningitidis Streptococcus pneumoniae N meningitidis meningitis occasionally causes death within hours.
Sepsis caused by N meningitidis sometimes results in coagulopathy and bilateral adrenal hemorrhagic infarction (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome).
Haemophilus influenzae type B, previously the most common cause of meningitis in children < 6 years and overall, is now a rare cause in the US and Western Europe, where the H influenzae vaccine is widely used.
However, in areas where the vaccine is not widely used, H influenzae is still a common cause, particularly in children aged 2 months to 6 years.
In middle-aged and in older adults, the most common cause of bacterial meningitis is S pneumoniae Less commonly, N meningitidis causes meningitis in middle-aged and older adults.
As host defenses decline with age, patients may develop meningitis due to L monocytogenes or gram-negative bacteria.
Table Route of entry Routes of entry include the following: By hematogenous spread (the most common route) From infected structures in or around the head (eg, sinuses, middle ear, mastoid process), sometimes associated with a CSF leak Through a penetrating head wound After a neurosurgical procedure (eg, if a ventricular shunt becomes infected) Through congenital or acquired defects in the skull or spine Having any of the above conditions increases the risk of acquiring meningitis.
Table Immune status Overall, the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in immunocompromised patients are S pneumoniae L monocytogenes Pseudomonas aeruginosa Mycobacterium tuberculosis N meningitidis Gram-negative bacteria But the most likely bacteria depend on the type of immune deficiency: Defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, in AIDS, Hodgkin lymphoma, or drug-induced immunosuppression): L monocytogenes or mycobacteria Defects in humoral immunity or splenectomy: S pneumoniae or, less frequently, N meningitidis (both can cause fulminant meningitis) Neutropenia: P aeruginosa or gram-negative enteric bacteria In very young infants (particularly preterm infants) and older adults, T-cell immunity may be weak; thus, these age groups are at risk of meningitis due to L monocytogenes.
Symptoms and Signs of Acute Bacterial Meningitis In most cases, bacterial meningitis begins with 3 to 5 days of insidiously progressive nonspecific symptoms including malaise, fever, irritability, and vomiting.
However, meningitis may be more rapid in onset and can be fulminant, making bacterial meningitis one of the few disorders in which a previously healthy young person may go to sleep with mild symptoms and never awaken.
Typical symptoms and signs of meningitis include Fever Tachycardia Headache Photophobia Changes in mental status (eg, lethargy, obtundation) Nuchal rigidity (although not all patients report it) Back pain (less intense than and overshadowed by headache) However, fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity may be absent in neonates and infants (see Neonatal Bacterial Meningitis).
So-called paradoxical irritability, in which cuddling and consoling by a parent irritates rather than comforts the neonate, suggests bacterial meningitis.
If meningitis becomes severe in neonates and infants, skull fontanelles may bulge because of increased intracranial pressure.
Seizures occur early in up to 40% of children with acute bacterial meningitis and may occur in adults.
Up to 12% of patients present in coma.
Severe meningitis increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and typically causes papilledema, but papilledema may be absent early or be attenuated because of age-related or other factors.
Accompanying systemic infection by the organism may cause Rashes, petechiae, or purpura (which suggest meningococcemia) Pulmonary consolidation (often in meningitis due to S pneumoniae) Heart murmurs (which suggest endocarditis—eg, often caused by S aureus or S pneumoniae) Atypical presentations in adults Fever and nuchal rigidity may be absent or mild in immunocompromised or older patients and in patients with alcohol use disorder.
Often, in older patients, the only sign is confusion in those who were previously alert or altered responsiveness in those who have dementia.
In such patients, as in neonates, the threshold for doing lumbar puncture should be low.
Brain imaging (MRI or, less optimally, CT) should be done if focal neurologic deficits are present or increased ICP is suspected.
If bacterial meningitis develops after a neurosurgical procedure, symptoms often take days to develop.
Diagnosis of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis As soon as acute bacterial meningitis is suspected, blood cultures and lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (unless contraindicated) are done.
Blood should be analysed when lumbar puncture is done so that blood glucose levels can be compared with CSF glucose levels.
Treatment should be started as follows: If bacterial meningitis is suspected and the patient is very ill, antibiotics and corticosteroids are given immediately, even before lumbar puncture.
If bacterial meningitis is suspected and lumbar puncture will be delayed pending CT or MRI, antibiotics and corticosteroids should be started after blood cultures but before neuroimaging is done; the need for confirmation should not delay treatment.
Clinicians should suspect bacterial meningitis in patients with typical symptoms and signs, usually fever, changes in mental status, and nuchal rigidity.
However, clinicians must be aware that symptoms and signs are different in neonates and infants and may be absent or initially mild in older patients, patients with alcoholic use disorder, and immunocompromised patients.
Diagnosis can be challenging in the following patients: Those who have had a neurosurgical procedure because such procedures can also cause changes in mental status and neck stiffness Older patients and patients with alcohol use disorder because changes in mental status may be due to metabolic encephalopathy (which may have multiple causes) or to falls and subdural hematomas Focal seizures or focal neurologic deficits may indicate a focal lesion such as a brain abscess.
Because untreated bacterial meningitis is lethal, tests should be done if there is even a small chance of meningitis.
Testing is particularly helpful in infants, older patients, patients with alcohol use disorder, immunocompromised patients, and patients who had neurosurgical procedure because symptoms may be atypical.
Pearls & Pitfalls Do a lumbar puncture even if clinical findings are not specific for meningitis, particularly in infants, older patients, patients with alcohol use disorder, immunocompromised patients, and patients who have had neurosurgery.
If findings suggest acute bacterial meningitis, routine tests include CSF analysis Complete blood count and differential Metabolic panel Blood cultures plus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), if available Lumbar puncture Unless contraindicated, lumbar puncture (see also How To Do Lumbar Puncture) is done immediately to obtain CSF for analysis, the mainstay of diagnosis.
Contraindications to immediate lumbar puncture are signs suggesting markedly increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or an intracranial mass effect (eg, due to edema, hemorrhage, or tumor).
Thus, lumbar puncture should be considered high risk with any of the following: Papilledema Focal neurologic deficits Focal seizures A known central nervous system mass lesion Large stroke Suspected central nervosus system focal infection In such cases, lumbar puncture may cause brain herniation and thus is deferred until neuroimaging (typically CT or MRI) is done to check for increased ICP or a mass effect.
When lumbar puncture is deferred, treatment is best begun immediately (after blood sampling for culture and before neuroimaging).
After ICP, if increased, has been lowered or if no mass effect or obstructive hydrocephalus is detected, lumbar puncture can be done.
CSF should be sent for analysis: cell count, protein, glucose, Gram staining, culture, PCR, and other tests as indicated clinically.
A multiplex film-array PCR panel can provide rapid screening for multiple bacteria and viruses plus Cryptococcus neoformans in a CSF sample.
This test, which is not always available, is used to supplement, not replace, culture and traditional tests.
CSF cell count should be determined as soon as possible because white blood cells (WBCs) may adhere to the walls of the collecting tube, resulting in a falsely low cell count; in extremely purulent CSF, WBCs may lyse.
Typical CSF findings in bacterial meningitis include the following (see table): Increased pressure Fluid that is often turbid A high WBC count (consisting predominantly of polymorphonuclear neutrophils) Elevated protein A low CSF: blood glucose ratio A CSF: blood glucose level of < 50% suggests possible meningitis.
Findings typically include headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity.
A CSF glucose level of ≤ 18 mg / dL or a CSF: blood glucose ratio of < 0.23 strongly suggests bacterial meningitis.
However, changes in CSF glucose may lag 30 to 120 minutes behind changes in blood glucose.
In acute bacterial meningitis, an elevated protein level (usually 100 to 500 mg / dL) indicates blood-brain barrier injury.
CSF cell count and protein and glucose levels in patients with acute bacterial meningitis are not always typical.
Table Identification of the causative bacteria in CSF involves Gram staining, culture, and, when available, PCR.
Gram staining provides information rapidly, but the information is limited.
For bacteria to be reliably detected with Gram stain, about 10 5 bacteria / mL must be present.
Results may be falsely negative if any of the following occur: CSF is handled carelessly.
Bacteria are not adequately resuspended after CSF has been allowed to settle.
Diagnosis is by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.
Errors in decolorization or reading of the slide occur.
If clinicians suspect an anaerobic infection or other unusual bacteria, they should tell the laboratory before samples are plated for cultures.
Prior antibiotic therapy can reduce the yield from Gram staining and culture.
PCR, if available, and latex agglutination tests to detect bacterial antigens may be a useful adjunctive tests, especially in patients who have already received antibiotics.
Determination of antibiotic sensitivity requires bacterial culture.
Until the cause of meningitis is confirmed, other tests using samples of CSF or blood may be done to check for other causes of meningitis, such as viruses (particularly herpes simplex), fungi, and cancer cells.
Other tests Samples from other sites suspected of being infected (eg, urinary or respiratory tract) should also be cultured.
Prognosis for Acute Bacterial Meningitis With antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate for children < 19 years may be as low as 3% but is often higher; survivors may be deaf and neuropsychologically impaired.
The mortality rate, even with antibiotic treatment, is about 17% for adults < 60 years but up to 37% in those > 60.
Community-acquired meningitis due to S aureus has a mortality rate in the range of 43%.
In general, mortality rate correlates with depth of obtundation or coma.
Factors associated with a poor prognosis include Age > 60 years Coexisting debilitating disorders A low Glasgow coma score at admission (see tables and) Focal neurologic deficits A low CSF cell count Increased CSF pressure (particularly) Seizures and a low CSF: serum glucose ratio may also indicate a poor prognosis.
Treatment of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Antibiotics Corticosteroids to decrease cerebral inflammation and edema Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy for acute bacterial meningitis.
In addition to antibiotics, treatment includes measures to decrease brain and cranial nerve inflammation and increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
Most patients are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).
Antibiotics Antibiotics must be bactericidal for the causative bacteria and must be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
If patients appear ill and findings suggest meningitis, antibiotics (see table) and corticosteroids are started as soon as blood cultures are drawn and even before lumbar puncture.
Also, if lumbar puncture is delayed pending neuroimaging results, antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment begins before neuroimaging.
Pearls & Pitfalls If patients appear ill and acute meningitis is suspected, treat them with antibiotics and corticosteroids as soon as blood for cultures is drawn.
Appropriate empiric antibiotics depend on the patient's age and immune status and route of infection (see table).
(See also Overview of Meningitis and Neonatal Bacterial Meningitis.)
In general, clinicians should use antibiotics that are effective against S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and S aureus.
In pregnant women, neonates, older patients, and immunocompromised patients, Listeria meningitis is possible; it requires specific antibiotic treatment, usually ampicillin.
Herpes simplex encephalitis can clinically mimic early bacterial meningitis; thus, acyclovir is added.
Antibiotic therapy may need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing.
Commonly used antibiotics include 3rd-generation cephalosporins for S pneumoniae and N meningitidis Ampicillin for L monocytogenes Vancomycin for penicillin-resistant strains of S pneumoniae and for S aureus Table Table Table Corticosteroids Dexamethasone is used to decrease cerebral and cranial nerve inflammation and edema; it should be given when therapy is started.
Adults are given 10 mg IV; children are given 0.15 mg / kg IV.
Dexamethasone is given immediately before or with the initial dose of antibiotics and every 6 hours for 4 days.
Use of dexamethasone is best-established for patients with pneumococcal meningitis.
Patients presenting with papilledema or signs of impending brain herniation are treated for increased ICP with the following: Elevation of the head of the bed to 30˚ Hyperventilation to a PCO2 of 27 to 30 mm Hg for not more than 24 hours to cause intracranial vasoconstriction Osmotic diuresis with IV mannitol Hyperventilation is used until other measures become effective and is not used for more than 24 hours.
Treatment of Anemia By Evan M Braunstein, MD, PhD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Jul 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education If identified, the cause of the anemia is treated.
When the hemoglobin (Hb) falls dangerously low (eg, < 7 g / dL [< 70 g / L] for patients without cardiopulmonary insufficiency or higher for patients with it), red blood cell (RBC) transfusion temporarily increases oxygen-carrying capacity.
RBC transfusion should be reserved for patients With or at high risk of cardiopulmonary symptoms With active, uncontrollable blood loss With some form of hypoxic or ischemic end-organ failure (eg, neurologic ischemic symptoms, angina, tachycardia in patients with underlying heart failure or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Transfusion procedures and blood components are discussed elsewhere, as is the evaluation of anemia.
Anemia of Renal Disease By Gloria F Gerber, MD, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Division of Hematology Reviewed / Revised Jun 2023 View Patient Education Diagnosis Treatment Anemia of renal disease is a hypoproliferative anemia resulting primarily from deficient erythropoietin (EPO) or a diminished response to it; it tends to be normocytic and normochromic.
The bone marrow may show erythroid hypoplasia.
RBC fragmentation identified on the peripheral smear, particularly if there is thrombocytopenia, suggests microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and warrants additional investigation and treatment.
Treatment of Anemia of Renal Disease Treatment of underlying renal disease Sometimes, recombinant erythropoietin and iron supplements Treatment of anemia of renal disease is directed at Improving renal function Increasing RBC production If renal function returns to normal, anemia is slowly corrected.
Recombinant EPO improves anemia and reduces transfusion needs in patients with chronic kidney disease and is generally initiated when hemoglobin is < 10 g / dL (< 100 g / dL).
In patients receiving long-term dialysis, recombinant erythropoietin (eg, epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) along with iron supplements is the treatment of choice.
However, because there is both reduced production of EPO and marrow resistance to EPO, the recombinant EPO dose may need to be higher.
The goal is a hemoglobin of 10 to 11.5 g / dL (100 to 115 g / L).
Careful monitoring of hemoglobin response is needed because adverse effects (eg, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, death) may occur when hemoglobin rises to > 12 to 13 g / dL (> 120 to 130 g / L).
Treatment includes measures to correct the underlying disorder and supplementation with EPO and sometimes iron.
In addition, adequate repletion of iron stores is required to ensure an adequate response to recombinant EPO, and concurrent iron supplementation is often needed.
In almost all cases, maximum increases in RBCs are reached by 8 to 12 weeks.
(See also Overview of Decreased Erythropoiesis.)
Anemia in chronic renal disease is multifactorial.
The most common mechanism is Hypoproliferation due to decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production Lack of EPO leads to loss of erythroferrone production, causing loss of hepcidin suppression and increased iron sequestration (as observed in the anemia of chronic disease — 1).
Renal glomerular lesions (eg, due to amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy) generally result in the most severe anemia for their degree of renal excretory failure.
Sickle Cell Disease (Hb S Disease) By Evan M Braunstein, MD, PhD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Jun 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Prognosis Treatment Key Points More Information Topic Resources Sickle Cells Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestry.
Complications are treated supportively.
No effective in vivo anti-sickling drug is available.
Splenectomy is valueless.
Indications for hospitalization include suspected serious (including systemic) infection, aplastic crisis, acute chest syndrome, and, often, intractable pain or the need for transfusion.
Fever alone may not be a reason to hospitalize.
However, patients who appear acutely ill and have a temperature > 38 ° C should be admitted so that cultures can be obtained and IV antibiotics can be given.
Antibiotics Patients with suspected serious bacterial infections or acute chest syndrome require broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately.
Analgesics Painful crises are managed with liberal administration of analgesics, usually opioids.
IV morphine (continuous or bolus) is effective and safe; meperidine is avoided.
During crises, pain and fever may persist for as long as 5 days.
Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders affecting the hemoglobin molecule.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often useful in reducing opioid requirements; however, they must be used cautiously in patients with renal disease.
Intravenous hydration Although dehydration contributes to sickling and may precipitate crises, it is unclear whether vigorous hydration is helpful during crises.
Nevertheless, maintaining normal intravascular volume has been a mainstay of therapy.
Oxygen Oxygen is given if needed to treat hypoxia.
Transfusion Transfusion is given in many situations in which its efficacy has not been demonstrated.
However, chronic transfusion therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrent cerebral thrombosis, especially in children, in an effort to maintain the Hb S percentage less than 30%.
In the acute setting, specific indications for transfusion include Acute splenic sequestration Aplastic crises Cardiopulmonary symptoms or signs (eg, high-output heart failure, hypoxemia with PO2 < 65 mm Hg) Preoperative use Priapism Life-threatening events that would benefit from improved oxygen delivery (eg, sepsis, severe infection, acute chest syndrome, stroke, acute organ ischemia) Sometimes pregnancy Transfusion is not helpful during an uncomplicated painful crisis.
Simple transfusion can be done when the goal is to correct anemia, such as during aplastic crisis or splenic or hepatic sequestration.
Exchange transfusion is done during severe acute events such as the acute chest syndrome or stroke in order to decrease the Hb S percentage and prevent ischemia.
It can be done with modern apheresis machines.
Hemoglobin S was the first abnormal hemoglobin to be identified.
If the initial hemoglobin is low (< 7 g / dL [< 70 g / L]), this process cannot be initiated before first transfusing red cells.
Partial exchange transfusion minimizes iron accumulation and hyperviscosity.
Curative treatments Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment for sickle cell disease.
Given the risks associated with this therapy, it is generally restricted to patients with advanced disease complications.
Gene therapy or gene editing techniques that reduce the amount of Hb S are currently in clinical trials.
This field is rapidly evolving and use of stem cell therapy to treat sickle cell disease will likely expand in the near future.
Health maintenance For long-term management the following interventions have reduced mortality, particularly during childhood: Pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae influenza (inactivated, not live), and meningococcal vaccines Early identification and treatment of serious bacterial infections Prophylactic antibiotics, including continuous prophylaxis with oral penicillin from age 4 months to 6 year Use of hydroxyurea and folate supplementation Supplemental folic acid, 1 mg orally once a day, is usually prescribed.
Hydroxyurea, by increasing Hb F and thereby reducing sickling, decreases painful crises (by 50%) and decreases acute chest syndrome and transfusion requirements.
It is indicated in patients with recurrent pain crises or other complications.
The dose of hydroxyurea is variable and is adjusted based on blood counts and adverse effects.
Homozygotes (about 0.3% of people with African ancestry in the United States) have sickle cell anemia; heterozygotes (8 to 13% of people with African ancestry in the United States) are typically not anemic but have a risk of other complications.
Hydroxyurea causes neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
It is also a teratogen and should not be given to females of child-bearing age.
Three additional drugs are available to treat sickle cell disease.
Both L-glutamine and crizanlizumab target vaso-occlusion and were found to decrease pain crises in controlled, randomized studies (1, 2).
L-glutamine is thought to reduce oxidative stress in sickle erythrocytes, while crizanlizumab inhibits P-selectin, which contributes to adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium.
Voxelotor inhibits polymerization of Hb S, stabilizes oxygenated hemoglobin, and was shown to increase hemoglobin levels in a randomized, controlled trial (3.
While these drugs are currently being incorporated into treatment regimens for sickle cell patients, data on their efficacy remain limited.
Transcranial Doppler flow studies in children can help predict risk of stroke, and many experts recommend annual screening for children from age 2 to 16 years.
Children at high risk appear to benefit from prophylactic, chronic exchange transfusions to keep Hb S at < 30% of total hemoglobin; iron overload is common and must be screened for and treated.
For patients receiving frequent red cell transfusions, chelation therapy to prevent or delay complications due to iron overload should be considered.
Pathophysiology of Sickle Cell Disease Hemoglobin (Hb) molecules consist of polypeptide chains whose chemical structure is genetically controlled.
N Engl J Med 381 (6): 509 - 519, 2019. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1903212 Key Points Patients homozygous for hemoglobin S have an abnormal beta chain, resulting in fragile, relatively inflexible red blood cells that can plug capillaries, causing tissue infarction and are prone to hemolysis, causing anemia.
Patients have various acute exacerbations including painful crisis, sequestration crisis, aplastic crisis, and acute chest syndrome.
Long-term consequences include pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, stroke, aseptic necrosis, and increased risk of infection.
For acute crises, give opioid analgesics for pain, check for worsening anemia (suggesting aplastic or sequestration crisis) and signs of acute chest syndrome or infection, restore normal intravascular volume using 0.9% saline and then give maintenance fluids.
Prevent infection by using vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics; limit painful crises and risk of disease complications by giving hydroxyurea.
Normal adult blood also contains ≤ 2.5% hemoglobin A2 (composed of alpha and delta chains) and < 1.4% hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin), which has gamma chains in the place of beta chains (see also Hemoglobinopathies in Pregnancy).
Hemoglobin F predominates during gestation and gradually decreases, particularly in the first months of life; its concentration increases in certain disorders of hemoglobin synthesis and in aplastic anemia, other bone marrow failure disorders, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.
It is caused by homozygous inheritance of genes for hemoglobin (Hb) S Sickle-shaped red blood cells cause vaso-occlusion and are prone to hemolysis, leading to severe pain crises, organ ischemia, and other systemic complications.
Different hemoglobins (Hbs), as distinguished by electrophoretic mobility, are alphabetically designated in order of discovery (eg, A, B, C), although the first abnormal hemoglobin, sickle cell hemoglobin, was designated Hb S Structurally different hemoglobins with the same electrophoretic mobility are named for the city or location in which they were discovered (eg, Hb S Memphis, Hb C Harlem).
In the US, common anemias include those caused by genetic mutations resulting in Hb S or Hb C disease, and the thalassemias.
In hemoglobin S, valine is substituted for glutamic acid in the 6th amino acid of the beta chain.
Distorted, inflexible RBCs adhere to vascular endothelium and plug small arterioles and capillaries, which leads to infarction.
Vaso-occlusion also causes endothelial injury, which results in inflammation and can lead to thromboses.
Because sickled RBCs are fragile, the mechanical trauma of circulation causes hemolysis (see Overview of Hemolytic Anemia).
Chronic compensatory marrow hyperactivity deforms the bones.
Acute exacerbations (crises) may develop frequently.
Acute exacerbations Acute exacerbations (crises) occur intermittently, often for no known reason.
In some cases, crisis appears to be precipitated by Fever Viral infection Local trauma Vaso-occlusive crisis (pain crisis) is the most common type; it is caused by tissue hypoxia and leads to ischemia and infarction, typically in the bones, but also in the spleen, lungs, or kidneys.
Aplastic crisis occurs when bone marrow erythropoiesis slows during acute infection due to human parvovirus, during which an acute erythroblastopenia may occur.
Acute chest syndrome results from pulmonary microvascular occlusion and is a common cause of death, with mortality rates of up to 10%.
It occurs in all age groups but is most common in childhood.
Repeated episodes predispose to chronic pulmonary hypertension.
Sequestration crisis typically occurs in children whose spleen has not yet become fibrotic due to repeated splenic infarction.
Acute sequestration of sickled cells in the spleen exacerbates anemia.
Hepatic sequestration may occur in children or adults, causing right upper quadrant pain.
Rapid enlargement of the liver can occur and may be accompanied by intrahepatic cholestasis and renal failure.
Infection, bone marrow aplasia, or lung involvement (acute chest syndrome) can develop acutely and be fatal.
Priapism, a serious complication that can cause erectile dysfunction, is most common in young men.
Complications Chronic spleen damage can lead to autoinfarction and increases susceptibility to infection, particularly pneumococcal and Salmonella infections (including Salmonella osteomyelitis).
These infections are especially common in early childhood and can be fatal.
Recurrent ischemia and infarction can cause chronic dysfunction of multiple different organ systems.
Complications include ischemic stroke, seizures, avascular necrosis of the hips, renal concentrating defects, renal papillary necrosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and retinopathy.
Heterozygotes Patients who are heterozygous (Hb AS) do not experience hemolysis or painful crises.
However, they do have an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and pulmonary embolism.
In addition, rhabdomyolysis and sudden death may occur during sustained, exhausting exercise.
Impaired ability to concentrate urine (hyposthenuria) is common.
Unilateral hematuria (by unknown mechanisms and usually from the left kidney) can occur but is self-limited. Typical renal papillary necrosis can occur but is less common than among homozygous patients, and there is an association with the extremely rare medullary carcinoma of the kidney.
Anemia is present, and sickle cells are usually evident on the peripheral smear.
Symptoms and Signs of Sickle Cell Disease Most symptoms occur only in patients who are homozygous and result from Anemia Vaso-occlusive events resulting in tissue ischemia and infarction Anemia is usually severe but varies among patients and is usually compensated; mild jaundice and pallor are common.
Hepatosplenomegaly is common in children, but because of repeated infarctions and subsequent fibrosis (autosplenectomy), the spleen in adults is commonly atrophied.
Cardiomegaly and systolic ejection (flow) murmurs are common.
Cholelithiasis and chronic punched-out skin ulcers around the ankles are common.
Painful vaso-occlusive crisis causes severe pain in long bones, the hands and feet, back, and joints.
Hip pain may result from avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
Severe abdominal pain, which may be due to hepatic vein thrombosis, may develop with or without vomiting and is usually accompanied by back and joint pain.
Acute chest syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of fever, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.
It may follow bacterial pneumonia.
Hypoxemia may develop rapidly, causing dyspnea.
Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease DNA testing (prenatal diagnosis) Peripheral smear Solubility testing Hemoglobin electrophoresis (or thin-layer isoelectric focusing) The type of testing done depends on the age of the patient.
DNA testing can be used for prenatal diagnosis or to confirm a diagnosis of the sickle cell genotype.
Screening of neonates is available in most US states and involves hemoglobin electrophoresis.
Screening and diagnosis in children and adults involve examination of the peripheral smear, hemoglobin solubility testing, and hemoglobin electrophoresis.
Prenatal screening The sensitivity of prenatal diagnosis has been greatly improved with the availability of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technology.
It is recommended for families at risk for sickle cell (eg, couples with medical or family histories of anemia or of suggestive ethnic background).
DNA samples can be obtained by chorionic villus sampling at 10 to 12 weeks' gestation.
Amniotic fluid can also be tested at 14 to 16 weeks.
Diagnosis is important for genetic counseling.
Painful crises are treated with analgesics and other supportive measures.
Newborn screening Universal testing is currently recommended and is frequently one of a battery of newborn screening tests.
To distinguish between hemoglobin (Hb) F, S, A, and C, the recommended tests are hemoglobin electrophoresis using cellulose acetate or acid citrate agar, thin-layer isoelectric focusing, or hemoglobin fractionation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Repeat testing at age 3 to 6 months may be necessary for confirmation.
Solubility testing for Hb S is unreliable during the first few months of life.
Screening and diagnosis of children and adults Patients with a family history of sickle cell disease or trait should be screened with peripheral smear, hemoglobin (Hb) solubility testing, and hemoglobin electrophoresis.
Patients with symptoms or signs suggesting the disorder or its complications (eg, poor growth, acute and unexplained bone pain, particularly in the fingers, aseptic necrosis of the femoral head, unexplained hematuria), and patients with African ancestry with normocytic anemia (particularly if hemolysis is present) require laboratory tests for hemolytic anemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and examination of RBCs for sickling.
If sickle cell disease is present, the red blood cell count is usually between 2 and 3 million / microL (2 and 3 x 10 12 / L) with hemoglobin reduced proportionately; cells are normocytic (microcytosis suggests a concomitant alpha or beta thalassemia).
Nucleated RBCs frequently appear in the peripheral blood, and reticulocytosis ≥ 10% is common.
Transfusions are occasionally required.
Hb S must be distinguished from other hemoglobin types with a similar electrophoretic pattern by showing the pathognomonic RBC morphology.
Bone marrow examination is not used for diagnosis.
If it is done to differentiate other anemias, it shows hyperplasia, with normoblasts predominating; bone marrow may become aplastic during sickling or severe infections.
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, if done to exclude other disorders (eg, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis causing hand and foot pain), is low.
Incidental findings on skeletal x-rays may include widening of the diploic spaces of the skull and a sun-ray appearance of the diploic trabeculations.
The long bones often show cortical thinning, irregular densities, and new bone formation within the medullary canal.
Unexplained hematuria, even among patients not suspected of having sickle cell disease, should prompt consideration of sickle cell trait.
Evaluation of exacerbations If patients with known sickle cell disease have acute exacerbations, including pain, fever, or other symptoms of infection, aplastic crisis is considered and a complete blood count and reticulocyte count are done.
A reticulocyte count < 1% suggests aplastic crisis, particularly when hemoglobin decreases below the patient's usual level.
In a painful crisis without aplasia, the white blood cell count rises, often with a shift to the left, particularly during bacterial infection.
Vaccines against bacterial infections, prophylactic antibiotics, and aggressive treatment of infections prolong survival.
The platelet count is usually increased but can fall with the acute chest syndrome.
If measured, serum bilirubin is usually elevated (eg, 2 to 4 mg / dL [34 to 68 micromol / L]), and urine may contain urobilinogen.
In patients with chest pain or difficulty breathing, acute chest syndrome and pulmonary embolism are considered; chest x-ray and pulse oximetry are necessary.
Because acute chest syndrome is the leading cause of death in sickle cell disease, early recognition and treatment are critical.
Hypoxemia or pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates on chest x-ray suggest acute chest syndrome or pneumonia.
Hypoxemia without pulmonary infiltrates suggests pulmonary embolism.
In patients with fever, infection and acute chest syndrome are considered; cultures, chest x-ray, and other appropriate diagnostic tests are done.
Prognosis for Sickle Cell Disease The life span of homozygous patients has steadily increased to > 50 years.
Common causes of death are acute chest syndrome, intercurrent infections, pulmonary emboli, infarction of a vital organ, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.
Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease Broad-spectrum antibiotics (for infection) Analgesics and IV hydration (for vaso-occlusive pain crisis) Oxygen (for hypoxia) Sometimes transfusions Immunizations, folic acid supplementation, and hydroxyurea (for health maintenance) Stem cell transplantation (for advanced complications) Treatment includes regular health maintenance measures as well as specific treatment of the complications as they arise.
Hemosiderosis By James Peter Adam Hamilton, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Sep 2022 View Patient Education Hemosiderosis is focal deposition of iron that does not typically cause tissue damage.
Another common site of accumulation is the kidneys, where hemosiderosis can result from extensive intravascular hemolysis.
Free hemoglobin is filtered at the glomerulus, resulting in iron deposition in the kidneys.
The renal parenchyma is not damaged, but severe hemosiderinuria may result in iron deficiency.
Focal hemosiderosis can result from hemorrhage within an organ.
Iron liberated from extravasated red blood cells is deposited within that organ, and significant hemosiderin deposits may eventually develop.
Iron loss due to hemorrhage can still occur and cause iron deficiency anemia because iron stored in nonhematopoietic tissues cannot be reused.
Chronic inflammatory syndromes, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the metabolic syndrome, can also lead to hemosiderosis.
In affected patients, abdominal MRI may show excess iron in the liver and spleen.
When the lungs are affected, the cause usually is recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, either idiopathic (eg, Goodpasture syndrome) or due to chronic pulmonary hypertension (eg, as a result of primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, or severe mitral stenosis).
Perioral Dermatitis By Jonette E Keri, MD, PhD, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Feb 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Diagnosis Treatment Topic Resources Perioral Dermatitis Perioral dermatitis is an erythematous, papulopustular facial eruption that resembles acne and / or rosacea but typically starts around the mouth.
Biopsy, which is generally not clinically necessary, shows spongiosis and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate affecting vellus hair follicles.
In the lupoid variant, granulomas may be present.
Treatment of Perioral Dermatitis Avoidance of fluorinated dental products and topical corticosteroids Topical or sometimes oral antibiotics Perioral dermatitis treatment is to stop fluorinated dental products and topical corticosteroids (if being used) and then use topical antibiotics (eg, erythromycin 2% or metronidazole 0.75% gel or cream 2 times a day).
If there is no response, oral doxycycline or minocycline 50 to 100 mg 2 times a day or oral tetracycline 250 to 500 mg 2 times a day (between meals) may be given for 4 weeks and then tapered to the lowest effective dose.
In contrast to acne, antibiotics can usually be stopped.
Topical pimecrolimus (for people > age 2 years) also reduces disease severity.
Isotretinoin has been successfully used to treat granulomatous perioral dermatitis.
Treatment includes avoidance of causes, and topical and sometimes oral antibiotics.
A variety of causes of perioral dermatitis have been proposed, including exposure to topical corticosteroids and / or fluoride in water and toothpaste, but the etiology of perioral dermatitis is unknown.
Despite its name, perioral dermatitis is not a true dermatitis.
The eruption classically starts at the nasolabial folds and spreads periorally, sparing a zone around the vermilion border of the lips.
But the eruption can also spread periorbitally and to the forehead.
Diagnosis of Perioral Dermatitis Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of perioral dermatitis is by appearance; perioral dermatitis is distinguished from acne by the absence of comedones and from rosacea by the latter's lack of lesions around the mouth and eyes.

Most patients itch, occasionally severely.
Papules may dominate with little or no scaling in children and pregnant women.
The rose or fawn color is not as evident in patients with darker skin; children more commonly have inverse pityriasis rosea (lesions in the axillae or groin that spread centrifugally).
Manifestations of Pityriasis Rosea Pityriasis Rosea (Herald Patch) Initially, most people develop one large scaly patch (herald patch; arrow), and within 1 to 2 weeks, smaller pink patches can occur on the trunk, arms, and legs.
Pityriasis Rosea Pityriasis rosea is characterized by an initial 2 - to 10-cm herald patch followed by centripetal eruption of oval papules and plaques with a slightly raised border, typically appearing along skin lines.

Pityriasis Rosea on the Groin This photo shows atypical (inverse) pityriasis rosea characterized by oval scaly plaques in the inguinal creases.
Image provided by E Laurie Tolman, MD.
Classically, lesions orient along skin lines, giving pityriasis rosea a Christmas tree-like distribution when multiple lesions appear on the back.
A prodrome of malaise, headache, and sometimes arthralgia precedes the lesions in a minority of patients.
Diagnosis of Pityriasis Rosea Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of pityriasis rosea is based on clinical appearance and distribution.
Differential diagnosis includes Tinea corporis Tinea versicolor Drug eruptions Psoriasis Parapsoriasis Pityriasis lichenoides chronica Lichen planus Secondary syphilis Serologic testing for syphilis is indicated when the palms or soles are affected, when a herald patch is not seen, or when lesions occur in an unusual sequence or distribution.
Treatment of Pityriasis Rosea Antipruritic therapy No specific treatment is necessary because the eruption usually remits within 5 weeks and recurrence is rare.
Pityriasis rosea most commonly occurs between ages 10 and 35.
Antipruritic therapy such as topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, or topical measures may be used as needed.
Some data suggest that acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times a day for 7 days may be helpful in patients who present early and have widespread disease, or present with flu-like symptoms.
Of note, pityriasis rosea during pregnancy (especially during the first 15 weeks of gestation) is associated with premature birth or fetal demise.
Pregnant women should be offered acyclovir; however, antiviral therapy has not proved to reduce obstetric complications.
Key Points Pityriasis rosea is a self-limited, inflammatory disorder of the skin possibly caused by human herpesvirus types 6, 7, or 8 or drugs.
An initial 2 - to 10-cm herald patch is followed by centripetal eruption of oval papules and plaques with a slightly raised and scaly border, typically appearing along skin lines.
Diagnose based on clinical appearance and distribution.
Pityriasis rosea during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy is associated with premature birth or fetal demise.
Pregnant women should be offered antiviral therapy, even though this has not proved to reduce obstetric complications.
The cause of pityriasis rosea may be viral infection (some research has implicated human herpesviruses 6, 7, and 8).
Drugs may cause a pityriasis rosea-like reaction.
Symptoms and Signs of Pityriasis Rosea The condition classically begins with a single, primary, 2 - to 10-cm herald patch that appears on the trunk or proximal limbs.
A general centripetal eruption of 0.5 - to 2-cm rose - or fawn-colored oval papules and plaques follows within 7 to 14 days.
The lesions have a scaly, slightly raised border (collarette) and resemble ringworm (tinea corporis).
Overview of Dental Emergencies By Michael N Wajdowicz, DDS, Veterans Administration Reviewed / Revised Oct 2022 View Patient Education Emergency dental treatment by a physician is sometimes required when a dentist is unavailable to treat the following conditions: Fractured and avulsed teeth Mandibular dislocation Postextraction problems (eg, bleeding, swelling and pain, alveolitis and osteomyelitis, and osteonecrosis of the jaw [ONJ]) Analgesia and treatment of infection Oral analgesics effective for most dental problems include acetaminophen 650 to 1000 mg every 6 hours and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen 400 to 800 mg every 6 hours.
For those who cannot tolerate penicillins, alternatives include cephalexin 2 g, azithromycin or clarithromycin 500 mg, or doxycycline 100 mg. All of these alternatives are also given once orally 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure.
Clindamycin is no longer recommended for prophylaxis.
Ibuprofen and acetaminophen also can be used together for a brief period, alternating the drugs every 3 hours.
For severe pain, these drugs may be combined with opioids such as codeine 60 mg; hydrocodone 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg; or oxycodone 5 mg.
Antibiotics for dental infections include amoxicillin 500 mg orally every 8 hours for 3 to 7 days, or penicillin VK 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 3 to 7 days.
In patients who are sensitive or allergic to penicillin or its analogs, azithromycin 250 mg is recommended with an initial loading dose of 500 mg followed by 4 days of 250 mg. Alternatively, clindamycin 300 mg orally every 6 hours for 3 to 7 days may be prescribed.
Patients should be monitored for possible resistance to azithromycin and increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection with clindamycin.
Patients who fail to respond to amoxicillin or penicillin can be switched to amoxicillin clavulanate 500/125 mg 3 times a day for 7 days; those with allergy to penicillins can be given metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day for 7 days along with their initial regimen (1).
Prophylactic antibiotics For prevention of infective endocarditis, the 2021 American Dental Association guidelines (2), as well as the American Heart Association (3), recommend prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing dental procedures only for patients with Prosthetic cardiac valves, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses or with prosthetic material used for valve repair Previous infective endocarditis Specific congenital heart diseases Cardiac transplant recipients with heart valve problems (valvulopathy) For patients with prosthetic joint implants, the American Dental Association 2021guidelines (2) state that prophylactic antibiotics are not typically recommended but may be considered for patients with Immunocompromised state Uncontrolled diabetes Past joint infection Recent joint placement Dental procedures requiring prophylaxis are those that require manipulation or perforation of gingival or oral mucosa or that involve the root end area of the teeth (ie, those most likely to cause bacteremia).
The preferred drug is amoxicillin 2 g once orally 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure.
Tropical Sprue By Zubair Malik, MD, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University Reviewed / Revised Mar 2023 View Patient Education Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Tropical sprue is a rare acquired disease, probably of infectious etiology, characterized by malabsorption and megaloblastic anemia.
Symptoms and Signs of Tropical Sprue Patients commonly have acute diarrhea with fever and malaise.
A chronic phase of milder diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, abdominal cramps, and fatigue follows.
Steatorrhea (foul-smelling, pale, bulky, and greasy stools) is common.
Nutritional deficiencies, especially of folate and vitamin B12, eventually develop after several months to years.
The patient may also have weight loss, glossitis, stomatitis, and peripheral edema.
Diagnosis of Tropical Sprue Endoscopy with small-bowel biopsy Blood tests to screen for consequences of malabsorption Tropical sprue is suspected in people who live in or have visited areas where the disease is endemic and who have megaloblastic anemia and symptoms of malabsorption.
The test of choice is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with small-bowel biopsy.
Characteristic histologic changes (see table) usually involve the entire small bowel and include blunting of the villi with infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the epithelium and lamina propria.
Unlike in celiac disease, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) and anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) are negative in patients with tropical sprue.
Diagnosis is clinical and by small-bowel biopsy.
Additional laboratory studies (eg, complete blood count; albumin; calcium; prothrombin time; iron, folate, and B12 levels) help evaluate nutritional status.
Barium small-bowel follow-through may show segmentation of the barium, dilation of the lumen, and thickening of the mucosal folds.
D-xylose absorption is abnormal in > 90% of cases.
However, these tests are not specific or essential for diagnosis of tropical sprue.
Treatment of Tropical Sprue Long-term tetracycline Treatment of tropical sprue is tetracycline 250 mg orally 4 times a day for 1 or 2 months, then 3 times a day for up to 6 months, depending on disease severity and response to treatment.
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times a day can be used instead of tetracycline.
Folate 5 to 10 mg orally once / day should be given for the first month along with vitamin B12 1 mg IM weekly for several weeks.
Megaloblastic anemia promptly abates, and the clinical response is dramatic.
Other nutritional replacements are given as needed.
Failure to respond after 4 weeks of therapy suggests another condition.
Tropical sprue is a malabsorption syndrome.
Etiology of Tropical Sprue Tropical sprue occurs chiefly in the Caribbean, southern India, and Southeast Asia, affecting both natives and visitors.
The illness is rare in visitors spending < 1 month in areas where the disease is endemic.
Although etiology is unclear, tropical sprue is thought to result from chronic infection of the small bowel by toxigenic strains of coliform bacteria.
Malabsorption of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia.
Tropical sprue has rarely been reported in the United States, and the incidence worldwide has been decreasing in recent decades, perhaps because of increasing use of antibiotics for acute traveler's diarrhea.
Intestinal Lymphangiectasia By Zubair Malik, MD, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University Reviewed / Revised Mar 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Intestinal lymphangiectasia is a rare disorder characterized by obstruction or malformation of the intramucosal lymphatics of the small bowel.
In acquired cases, the defect may be secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis, constrictive pericarditis, pancreatitis, neoplastic tumors, and infiltrative disorders that block the lymphatics.
Impaired lymphatic drainage leads to increased pressure and leakage of lymph into the intestinal lumen.
Impairment of chylomicron and lipoprotein absorption results in malabsorption of fats and protein.
Because carbohydrates are not absorbed through the lymphatic system, their uptake is not impaired.
Symptoms and Signs of Intestinal Lymphangiectasia Early manifestations of intestinal lymphangiectasia include massive and often asymmetric peripheral edema, intermittent diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Some patients have mild to moderate steatorrhea (foul-smelling, pale, bulky, and greasy stools).
Chylous pleural effusions (chylothorax) and chylous ascites may be present.
Growth is retarded if onset is in the first decade of life.
Diagnosis of Intestinal Lymphangiectasia Endoscopic small-bowel biopsy Sometimes contrast lymphangiography Diagnosis of intestinal lymphangiectasia usually requires endoscopic small-bowel biopsy, which shows marked dilation and ectasia of the mucosal and submucosal lymphatic vessels at the tips of the villi.
Alternatively, contrast lymphangiography (injection of contrast material via the pedal lymphatics) can show abnormal intestinal lymphatics.
Laboratory abnormalities include lymphocytopenia and low levels of serum albumin, cholesterol, IgA, IgM, IgG, transferrin, and ceruloplasmin.
Barium studies may show thickened, nodular mucosal folds that resemble stacked coins.
D-xylose absorption is normal.
Intestinal protein loss can be shown by using chromium - 51-labeled albumin.
Treatment of Intestinal Lymphangiectasia Supportive care Sometimes surgical resection or repair Abnormal lymphatics cannot be corrected.
Supportive treatment of intestinal lymphangiectasia includes a low-fat (< 30 g / day), high-protein diet containing medium-chain triglyceride supplements.
Supplemental calcium and fat-soluble vitamins are given.
Intestinal resection or anastomosis of the abnormal lymphatics to the venous channels may be beneficial.
Pleural effusions should be drained by thoracentesis.
Symptoms include those of malabsorption, with edema and growth retardation.
Intestinal lymphangiectasia is a malabsorption disorder.
Malformation of the lymphatic system is congenital or acquired.
Congenital cases usually manifest in children (typically diagnosed before age 3 years) and less frequently in adolescents or young adults.
Males and females are equally affected.
Levator Syndrome By Parswa Ansari, MD, Hofstra Northwell-Lenox Hill Hospital, New York Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Levator syndrome is episodic rectal pain caused by spasm of the levator ani muscle.
In severe cases, the pain can persist for many hours and recur frequently.
The patient may have undergone various rectal operations for these symptoms, with no benefit.
Diagnosis of Levator Syndrome Clinical evaluation Physical examination can exclude other painful rectal conditions (eg, thrombosed hemorrhoids, fissures, abscesses).
Physical examination is often normal, although tenderness or tightness of the levator muscle, usually on the left, may be present.
Occasional cases are caused by low back or prostate disorders.
Other causes of pelvic pain (eg, cancer) must be ruled out.
In most cases, a distinct cause of levator syndrome is not identified.
Treatment of Levator Syndrome Analgesics, sitz baths Sometimes electrogalvanic stimulation Treatment of levator syndrome consists of explanations to the patient of the benign nature of the condition.
An acute episode may be relieved by the passage of gas or a bowel movement, by a sitz bath, or by a mild analgesic.
When the symptoms are more intense, physical therapy may be effective.
Skeletal muscle relaxants or anal sphincter massage under local or regional anesthesia can be tried, but the benefit is unclear.
Treatment includes analgesics and sitz baths and sometimes physical therapy.
Proctalgia fugax (fleeting pain in the rectum) and coccydynia (pain in the coccygeal region) are variants of levator syndrome.
Symptoms and Signs of Levator Syndrome Rectal spasm causes pain, typically unrelated to defecation, usually lasting < 20 minutes.
It may occur spontaneously or with sitting and can waken the patient from sleep.
The pain may feel as if it would be relieved by the passage of gas or a bowel movement.
Dysphagia Lusoria By Kristle Lee Lynch, MD, Perelman School of Medicine at The University of Pennsylvania Reviewed / Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Dysphagia lusoria is caused by compression of the esophagus from any of several congenital vascular abnormalities.
The vascular abnormality is usually an aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the left side of the aortic arch, a double aortic arch, or a right aortic arch with left ligamentum arteriosum.
The dysphagia may develop in childhood or later in life as a result of arteriosclerotic changes in the aberrant vessel.
Barium swallow shows the extrinsic compression, but arteriography is necessary for absolute diagnosis.
Most patients require no treatment, but surgical repair is sometimes done after careful weighing of risks and benefits.
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome By James Fernandez, MD, PhD, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an immunodeficiency disorder that involves a combined B - and T-cell defect and is characterized by recurrent infection, eczema, and thrombocytopenia.
Br J Haematol 106 (4): 875 - 883, 1999. doi: 10.1046 / j.1365 - 2141.1999.01637.x Symptoms and Signs of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome The first manifestations are often hemorrhagic (usually bloody diarrhea), followed by recurrent respiratory infections, eczema, and thrombocytopenia.
Cancers, especially B-cell lymphomas (EBV+) and acute lymphocytic leukemia, develop in about 10% of patients > 10 years.
Diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Immunoglobulin levels Platelet count and volume assessment White blood cell function tests (eg, neutrophil chemotaxis, T-cell function) Diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is based on the following: Decreased T-cell count and function Elevated IgE and IgA levels Low IgM levels Low or normal IgG levels Decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis Antibodies to polysaccharide antigens (eg, blood group antigens A and B) may be selectively deficient; quantitative immunoglobulin response to polysaccharide vaccines (eg, pneumococcal vaccine) is usually measured.
Platelets are small and defective, and splenic destruction of platelets is increased, causing thrombocytopenia.
Mutation analysis may be used to confirm the diagnosis if there is clinical and laboratory evidence of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
Genetic testing is recommended for 1st-degree relatives.
Because risk of lymphoma and leukemia is increased, a complete blood count with differential is usually done every 6 months.
Acute changes in symptoms related to B-cell dysfunction require more in-depth evaluations.
Treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Supportive care using prophylactic immune globulin, antibiotics, and acyclovir For symptomatic thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion and rarely splenectomy Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Gene therapy Treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is prophylactic antibiotics and immune globulin to prevent recurrent bacterial infections, acyclovir to prevent severe herpes simplex virus infections, and platelet transfusions to treat hemorrhage.
If thrombocytopenia is severe, splenectomy can be done, but it is usually avoided because it increases risk of septicemia.
The most well-established cure is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but gene therapy is under study.
A recent small study of lentiviral hematopoietic stem / progenitor cell gene therapy in 8 patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome followed for up to 7.6 years demonstrated resolution of severe infections and eczema and a decrease in autoimmune and bleeding disorders in all of the patients (1).
Without aggressive intervention with transplantation or gene therapy, most patients die by age 15; however, some patients survive into adulthood.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that involves combined humoral and cellular immunity deficiencies.
Inheritance is X-linked recessive.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a cytoplasmic protein necessary for normal B - and T-cell signaling.
Thrombocytopenia likely occurs due to various reasons, including increased platelet clearance, ineffective thrombocytopoiesis, and / or decreased platelet survival (1).
Because B - and T-cell functions are impaired, infections with pyogenic bacteria and opportunistic organisms, particularly viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii, develop.
Infections with varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus are common.
Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) By James Fernandez, MD, PhD, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Common variable immunodeficiency (acquired or adult-onset hypogammaglobulinemia) is characterized by low immunoglobulin (Ig) levels with phenotypically normal B cells that can proliferate but do not develop into Ig-producing cells.
Impaired T-cell immunity also may be present in some patients.
Autoimmune disorders can occur, including autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison disease, thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and alopecia areata.
Patients also may develop malabsorption, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, systemic granulomatous inflammation, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, splenomegaly, and / or bronchiectasis.
Gastric carcinoma or lymphoma occurs in 10% of patients.
Symptoms and Signs of CVID Patients with CVID have recurrent sinopulmonary infections causing sinus congestion and pressure, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, mucus production, fevers, chills, and / or lymphadenopathy.
Diagnosis of CVID Measurement of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) and antibody titers Flow cytometry for T-cell and B-cell subsets Serum protein electrophoresis Diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency is suggested by recurrent sinopulmonary infections and requires all of the following: Low (at least 2 standard deviations below the mean) levels of IgG Low levels of IgA, IgM, or both Impaired response to immunizations (usually both protein and polysaccharide vaccines) Exclusion of other immunodeficiency disorders Antibody or autoantibody levels should not be measured if patients have been treated with IV immune globulin (IVIG) within the previous 6 months because any detected antibodies may be from the IVIG.
B-cell and T-cell quantification by flow cytometry is done to exclude other immunodeficiency disorders and to distinguish CVID from X-linked agammaglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia; findings may include low numbers of class-switched memory B cells or CD21+ cells.
Serum protein electrophoresis is done to screen for monoclonal gammopathies (eg, myeloma), which may be associated with reduced levels of other immunoglobulin isotypes.
Spirometry, complete blood count, liver tests, and a basic metabolic panel are recommended yearly to check for associated disorders.
If lung function changes, CT should be done.
Patients have recurrent sinopulmonary infections.
Because mutations are usually sporadic, screening relatives is not recommended unless there is a significant family history of CVID.
Treatment of CVID Prophylactic immune globulin (IgG) replacement therapy Antibiotics for infections Disease-specific treatment for comorbid immunodeficiency disorders such as granulomatous lung disease or associated autoimmune disease Treatment of CVID consists of immune globulin and antibiotics as needed to treat infection.
Rituximab, vedolizumab, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - alpha inhibitors (eg, etanercept, infliximab), corticosteroids, and / or other treatments may be required to treat complications such as autoimmune disorders, immune enteropathy, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and granulomatous inflammation.
Diagnosis is based mainly on serum Ig levels.
Treatment includes prophylactic IgG replacement therapy and antibiotics for infection.
Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that involves humoral immunity deficiencies.
It includes several different known molecular defects, but in most patients, the molecular defect is unknown.
Mutations are sporadic in > 90% of cases.
CVID is clinically similar to X-linked agammaglobulinemia in the types of infections that develop, but onset tends to be later (typically between ages 20 and 40).
Early Repolarization Syndrome By L Brent Mitchell, MD, Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, University of Calgary Reviewed / Revised Jan 2023 View Patient Education Diagnosis Treatment Early repolarization syndrome is a genetic disorder of cardiomyocyte ion channel function (channelopathy).
The risk of arrhythmia is higher when the early repolarization pattern is in the inferior leads, the lateral leads, or both.
Early repolarization syndrome appears to result from mutations that produce a Gain of function of outward potassium current channels OR Loss of function of inward sodium or calcium current channels These ion channel changes magnify the normal small transmural voltage gradients during the plateau phase of the action potential.
These gradients produce a J-wave and J-point elevation on the ECG and predispose to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.
Prior to the VT / VF the early repolarization pattern may become more exaggerated and the VT / VF may be precipitated by an episode of myocardial ischemia.
The polymorphic VT is often initiated by a short-long-short RR interval sequence (although this sequence is not specific for early repolarization syndrome): The first short RR interval is between a baseline beat (usually a normal beat) and a premature beat (usually a premature ventricular beat).
The long RR interval is the post-extra-systolic pause and ends with a baseline beat (usually a normal beat).
This pause is followed by a short RR interval when the VT begins.
Early repolarization syndrome appears to be inheritable, but disease-specific gene mutations are rarely identified, suggesting that the disorder is often polygenic.
The ventricular arrhythmias may cause palpitations, and / or cardiac arrest.
Syncope may occur but is uncommon because VT that occurs with early repolarization syndrome rarely self-terminates (unlike with some other disorders that cause VT in which syncope is more common).
Patients are predisposed to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).
Diagnosis of Early Repolarization Syndrome Characteristic clinical and ECG manifestations Clinical screening of first-degree family members Diagnosis should be considered in patients who have had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden cardiac arrest (or a family history of those events in the absence of structural heart disease) and who also have ECG changes showing an inferior and / or lateral early repolarization pattern.
The typical ECG finding of early repolarization is J-point elevation of ≥ 1 mm (≥ 0.1 mV) followed by ST segment elevation in two or more contiguous inferior and / or lateral leads.
Because specific gene defects are seldom identified, genetic testing is not typically recommended for patients or family members.
However, first-degree family members should be evaluated clinically and with an ECG.
Treatment of Early Repolarization Syndrome Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if symptomatic For asymptomatic patients with the early repolarization ECG pattern and no family history of sudden death, no treatment is recommended because such patients are at very low risk.
Patients who have had cardiac arrest or who have demonstrated VF or polymorphic VT are at high risk and should have an ICD placed.
An ICD should be considered for certain patients with the early repolarization ECG pattern and certain other high-risk features (1).
When frequent ICD discharges need to be suppressed, quinidine, which blocks the outward potassium current that may be increased in early repolarization syndrome, may be efficacious.
IV isoproterenol may be useful in patients who have multiple episodes of ventricular arrhythmias in quick succession (electrical storm).
Some patients require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
Early repolarization refers to ECG findings typically including J-point elevation ≥ 0.1 mV, often with a slurred or notched appearance, followed by ST-segment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads.
This ECG pattern is not uncommon, as it occurs in about 5% to 10% of the population, especially in men, younger patients, and athletes.
Most people with this early repolarization ECG pattern do not manifest arrhythmias.
However, early repolarization is substantially more common in survivors of apparently idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and early repolarization syndrome refers to people with early repolarization on ECG who also have had symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias.
Cor Pulmonale By Nowell M Fine, MD, SM, Libin Cardiovascular Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary Reviewed / Revised Sep 2022 View Patient Education Pathophysiology Etiology Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Cor Pulmonale (Echocardiogram) Causes of Cor Pulmonale Cor pulmonale is right ventricular (RV) enlargement secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension.
Demands on the RV may be intensified by increased blood viscosity due to hypoxia-induced polycythemia.
Rarely, RV failure affects the LV if a dysfunctional septum bulges into the LV, interfering with filling and thus causing diastolic dysfunction.
Etiology of Cor Pulmonale Acute cor pulmonale has few causes.
Chronic cor pulmonale is usually caused by COPD, but there are several less common causes (see table).
In patients with COPD, an acute exacerbation or pulmonary infection may trigger RV overload.
Table Symptoms and Signs of Cor Pulmonale Initially, cor pulmonale is asymptomatic, although patients usually have significant symptoms (eg, dyspnea, exertional fatigue) due to the underlying lung disorder.
Later, as RV pressures increase, physical signs commonly include a left parasternal systolic lift, a loud pulmonic component of the 2nd heart sound (S2), and murmurs of functional tricuspid and pulmonic insufficiency (regurgitation).
Later, an RV gallop rhythm (3rd [S3] and 4th [S4] heart sounds) augmented during inspiration, distended jugular veins (with a dominant a wave unless tricuspid regurgitation is present), hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema may occur.
Diagnosis of Cor Pulmonale Clinical suspicion Echocardiography Cor pulmonale should be suspected in all patients with one of its causes.
Chest x-ray shows RV and proximal pulmonary artery enlargement with distal arterial attenuation.
ECG evidence of RV hypertrophy (eg, right axis deviation, QR wave in lead V1, and dominant R wave in leads V1 to V3) correlates well with degree of pulmonary hypertension.
However, because pulmonary hyperinflation and bullae in COPD cause realignment of the heart, physical examination, x-rays, and ECG may be relatively insensitive.
Echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is done to evaluate LV and RV function; echocardiography can assess RV systolic pressure but is often technically limited by the lung disorder; cardiac MRI may be helpful in some patients to assess cardiac chambers and function.
Right heart catheterization may be required for confirmation.
Treatment of Cor Pulmonale Treatment of cause Treatment of cor pulmonale is difficult; it focuses on the cause (see table), particularly alleviation or moderation of hypoxia.
Early identification and treatment are important before structural changes become irreversible.
If peripheral edema is present, diuretics may seem appropriate, but they are helpful only if LV failure and pulmonary fluid overload are also present.
Diuretics should be used cautiously because small decreases in preload often worsen cor pulmonale.
Pulmonary vasodilators (eg, hydralazine, calcium channel blockers, nitrous oxide, prostacyclin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors), although beneficial in primary pulmonary hypertension, are not effective.
Findings include peripheral edema, neck vein distention, hepatomegaly, and a parasternal lift.
Bosentan, an endothelin receptor blocker, also may benefit patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, but its use is not well studied in cor pulmonale.
Digoxin is effective only if patients have concomitant LV dysfunction; caution is required because patients with COPD are sensitive to digoxin 's effects.
Phlebotomy during hypoxic cor pulmonale has been suggested, but the benefits of decreasing blood viscosity are not likely to offset the harm of reducing oxygen-carrying capacity unless significant polycythemia is present.
For patients with chronic cor pulmonale, long-term anticoagulants reduce risk of venous thromboembolism.
Key Points Cor pulmonale is RV enlargement and eventually failure secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension.
Cor pulmonale itself is usually asymptomatic but common physical findings include a left parasternal systolic lift, a loud pulmonic component of S2, functional tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation murmurs, and later, distended jugular veins, hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema.
Diagnosis usually requires echocardiography or radionuclide imaging, and sometimes right heart catheterization.
Early identification and treatment of the cause are important before cardiac structural changes become irreversible.
Although patients may have significant peripheral edema, diuretics are not helpful and may be harmful; small decreases in preload often worsen cor pulmonale.
Diagnosis is clinical and by echocardiography.
Cor pulmonale is usually chronic but may be acute and reversible.
Primary pulmonary hypertension (ie, not caused by a pulmonary or cardiac disorder) is discussed elsewhere.
Pathophysiology of Cor Pulmonale Lung disorders cause pulmonary hypertension that can lead to cor pulmonale by several mechanisms: Loss of capillary beds (eg, due to bullous changes in COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] or thrombosis in pulmonary embolism) Vasoconstriction caused by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or both Increased alveolar pressure (eg, in COPD, during mechanical ventilation) Medial hypertrophy in arterioles (often a response to pulmonary hypertension due to other mechanisms) Pulmonary hypertension increases afterload on the RV, resulting in a cascade of events that is similar to what occurs in LV failure, including elevated end-diastolic and central venous pressure and ventricular hypertrophy and dilation.
In VF, synchronization of a shock to the QRS complex is neither necessary nor possible.
A DC shock applied without synchronization to a QRS complex is DC defibrillation.
Direct current (DC) cardioversion or defibrillation can be delivered as Monophasic current Biphasic current Monophasic current travels in one direction between the two electrodes.
In biphasic devices, the current reverses direction part way through the shock waveform.
The biphasic device requires lower energy and has been shown to lead to higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
However, survival outcomes are similar in both devices (1).
Most manual and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are now biphasic because of increased efficiency at restoring sinus rhythm.
Biphasic devices are also smaller in size (making the devices more portable).
Procedure for DC cardioversion When DC cardioversion is elective, patients should fast for 6 to 8 hours to avoid the possibility of aspiration.
Because the procedure is frightening and painful, brief general anesthesia or IV analgesia and sedation (eg, fentanyl 1 mcg / kg, then midazolam 1 to 2 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 5 mg) is necessary.
Equipment and personnel to maintain the airways must be present.
After synchronization to the QRS complex is confirmed on the monitor, a shock is given.
The most appropriate energy level varies with the tachyarrhythmia being treated.
For defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, the energy level for the first shock is 120 to 200 joules for biphasic devices (or according to manufacturer specification) although many practitioners use the maximum device output in this setting 360 joules for monophasic devices (or according to manufacturer specification) Subsequent shocks are at the same or higher energy level for biphasic devices and are at the same level for monophasic devices.
For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, the energy level for the first shock is 100 to 200 joules for biphasic devices (or depending on manufacturer specification) 200 joules for monophasic devices (or according to manufacturer specification) Subsequent shocks are at the same or higher energy level for both biphasic and monophasic devices.
DC cardioversion-defibrillation can also be applied directly to the heart during a thoracotomy or through use of an intracardiac electrode catheter; then, much lower energy levels are required.
Less commonly, but more likely if patients have marginal left ventricular function or multiple shocks are used, cardioversion precipitates myocyte damage and electromechanical dissociation.
If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs, direct current (DC) cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used.
A transthoracic DC shock of sufficient magnitude depolarizes the entire myocardium, rendering the entire heart momentarily refractory to repeat depolarization.
Thereafter, the most rapid intrinsic pacemaker, usually the sinoatrial (SA) node, reassumes control of heart rhythm.
However, it is less effective for terminating tachyarrhythmias that result from automaticity because the return rhythm is likely to be the automatic tachyarrhythmia.
In the remaining 20% of patients with Raynaud symptoms, a causative underlying disease (eg, systemic sclerosis) will be evident at initial presentation or diagnosed subsequently.
Secondary Raynaud syndrome accompanies various disorders and conditions, mostly connective tissue disorders (see table Causes of Secondary Raynaud Syndrome).
Table Nicotine commonly contributes to secondary Raynaud syndrome but is often overlooked.
Raynaud syndrome may accompany migraine headaches, variant angina, and pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that these disorders share a common vasospastic mechanism.
Symptoms and Signs of Raynaud Syndrome Sensations of coldness, burning pain, paresthesias, or intermittent color changes of one or more digits are precipitated by exposure to cold, emotional stress, or vibration.
Rewarming the hands accelerates restoration of normal color and sensation.
Color changes are clearly demarcated across the digit.
They may be triphasic (pallor, followed by cyanosis and after warming by erythema due to reactive hyperemia), biphasic (cyanosis, erythema), or uniphasic (pallor or cyanosis only).
Changes are often symmetric.
Raynaud syndrome does not occur proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints; it most commonly affects the middle 3 fingers and rarely affects the thumb.
Vasospasm may last minutes to hours but is rarely severe enough to cause tissue loss in primary Raynaud syndrome.
Raynaud syndrome secondary to a connective tissue disorder may progress to painful digital gangrene; Raynaud syndrome secondary to systemic sclerosis tends to cause extremely painful, infected ulcers on the fingertips.
Manifestations of Raynaud Syndrome Raynaud Syndrome With Cyanosis Multiple fingertips are cyanotic.

© Springer Science+Business Media Diagnosis of Raynaud Syndrome Clinical criteria Examination and testing for underlying disorder Raynaud syndrome itself is diagnosed clinically.
Acrocyanosis also causes color change of the digits in response to cold but differs from Raynaud syndrome in that it is persistent, not easily reversed, and does not cause trophic changes, ulcers, or pain.
Primary and secondary forms are distinguished clinically, supported by vascular laboratory studies and blood testing.
Clinical findings A thorough history and physical examination directed at identifying a causative disorder are helpful but rarely diagnostic.
Occasionally, other acral parts (eg, nose, tongue) are affected.
Findings suggesting primary Raynaud syndrome are the following: Age at onset < 40 (in two thirds of cases) Mild symmetric attacks affecting both hands No tissue necrosis or gangrene No history or physical findings suggesting another cause Findings suggesting secondary Raynaud syndrome are the following: Age at onset > 30 Severe painful attacks that may be asymmetric and unilateral Ischemic lesions History and findings suggesting an accompanying disorder Laboratory testing Vascular laboratory testing includes measuring digital pulse wave forms and pressures.
The main blood tests are to diagnose collagen vascular diseases (eg, measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein, antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anticentromere antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [CCP] antibodies, anti-scleroderma [SCL] 70 antibody).
Treatment of Raynaud Syndrome Trigger avoidance Smoking cessation Calcium channel blockers or prazosin Treatment of primary Raynaud syndrome involves avoidance of cold, smoking cessation, and, if stress is a triggering factor, relaxation techniques (eg, biofeedback) or counseling.
Drugs are used more often than behavioral treatments because of convenience.
Vasodilating calcium channel blockers (eg, extended-release nifedipine 60 to 90 mg orally once a day, amlodipine 5 to 20 mg orally once a day, felodipine 2.5 to 10 mg orally twice a day, or isradipine 2.5 to 5 mg orally twice a day) are most effective, followed by prazosin 1 to 5 mg orally once a day or twice a day.
Topical nitroglycerine paste, pentoxifylline 400 mg orally twice or 3 times a day with meals, or both may be effective, but no evidence supports routine use.
Beta-blockers, clonidine, and ergot preparations are contraindicated because they cause vasoconstriction and may trigger or worsen symptoms.
Treatment of secondary Raynaud syndrome focuses on the underlying disorder.
Calcium channel blockers or prazosin is also indicated, given as above for primary Raynaud syndrome.
Antibiotics, analgesics, and, occasionally, surgical debridement may be necessary for ischemic ulcers.
The disorder may be primary or secondary.
Low-dose aspirin may prevent thrombosis but theoretically may worsen vasospasm via prostaglandin inhibition.
IV prostaglandins (alprostadil, epoprostenol, iloprost) appear to be effective and may be an option for patients with ischemic digits.
However, these drugs are not widely available, and their role is yet to be defined.
Cervical or local sympathectomy is controversial; it is reserved for patients with progressive disability unresponsive to all other measures, including treatment of underlying disorders.
Sympathectomy often abolishes the symptoms, but relief may last only 1 to 2 years.
Key Points Raynaud syndrome is reversible vasospasm of parts of the hand in response to cold or emotional stress.
Raynaud syndrome may be primary or secondary to another disorder, typically one affecting connective tissue.
Primary Raynaud syndrome, unlike the secondary form, rarely causes gangrene or tissue loss.
Diagnose clinically but consider testing to diagnose a suspected cause.
Avoid cold, smoking, and any other triggers.
Diagnosis is clinical; testing focuses on distinguishing primary from secondary disease.
Give a vasodilating calcium channel blocker or prazosin.
Treatment of uncomplicated cases includes avoidance of cold, biofeedback, smoking cessation, and, as needed, vasodilating calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine) or prazosin.
Overall prevalence is about 3 to 5%; women are affected more than men, and younger people are affected more than older people.
Raynaud syndrome is probably due to an exaggerated alpha-2 adrenergic response that triggers vasospasm; the mechanism is not defined.
Primary Raynaud syndrome is much more common (> 80% of cases) than secondary; it occurs without symptoms or signs of other disorders.
Revascularization for Acute Coronary Syndromes By Ranya N Sweis, MD, MS, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Arif Jivan, MD, PhD, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Reviewed / Revised Jun 2022 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Topic Resources Thrombolysis in Myocardial... Fibrinolytic Therapy for STEMI Revascularization is the restoration of blood supply to ischemic myocardium in an effort to limit ongoing damage, reduce ventricular irritability, and improve short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes.
ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Emergency PCI is the preferred treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when available in a timely fashion (door to balloon-inflation time < 90 minutes) by an experienced operator (1).
Indications for urgent PCI later in the course of STEMI include hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmias requiring transvenous pacing or repeated cardioversion, and age > 75.
If the lesions necessitate CABG, there is about 4 to 12% mortality and a 20 to 43% morbidity rate.
If there is likely to be a significant delay in availability of PCI, thrombolysis should be done for STEMI patients meeting criteria (see table Fibrinolytic Therapy for STEMI).
Used with aspirin, fibrinolytics reduce hospital mortality rate by 30 to 50% and improve ventricular function.
Modes of revascularization include: Thrombolysis with fibrinolytic drugs Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with or without stent placement Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) The use, timing, and modality of revascularization depend on which acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is present, timing of presentation, extent and location of anatomic lesions, and availability of personnel and facilities (see figure — 1).
Prehospital use of fibrinolytics by trained paramedics can significantly reduce time to treatment and should be considered in situations in which PCI within 90 minutes is not possible, particularly in patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset.
Regardless, most patients who undergo thrombolysis will ultimately require transfer to a PCI-capable facility for elective angiography and PCI as necessary before discharge.
PCI should be considered after fibrinolytics if chest pain or ST-segment elevation persists ≥ 60 minutes after initiation of fibrinolytics or if pain and ST-segment elevation recur, but only if PCI can be initiated < 90 minutes after onset of recurrence.
If PCI is unavailable, fibrinolytics can be repeated.
Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Immediate reperfusion is not as urgent in patients with uncomplicated non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in whom a completely occluded infarct-related artery at presentation is uncommon, or in patients with unstable angina who respond to medical therapy.
A noninterventional approach and a trial of medical management are used for patients in whom angiography demonstrates Only a small area of myocardium at risk Lesion morphology not amenable to PCI Anatomically insignificant disease (< 50% coronary stenosis) Significant left main disease in patients who are candidates for CABG Further, angiography or PCI should be deferred in favor of medical management for patients with a high risk of procedure-related morbidity or mortality.
By contrast, patients with persistent chest pain despite maximal medical therapy or complications (eg, markedly elevated cardiac markers, presence of cardiogenic shock, acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, unstable arrhythmias) should proceed directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to identify coronary lesions requiring PCI or CABG.
As in patients with stable angina, CABG has historically been preferred over PCI for patients with left main or left main equivalent disease (although the data supporting this practice are changing) and for those with left ventricular dysfunction or diabetes.
CABG must also be considered when PCI is unsuccessful, cannot be used (eg, in lesions that are long or near bifurcation points), or causes acute coronary artery dissection.
Fibrinolytics are not indicated for unstable angina or NSTEMI.
Lumbar Herniated Nucleus Pulposus (Herniated Lumbar Disk; Ruptured Lumbar Disk; Prolapsed Intervertebral Disk) By Peter J Moley, MD, Hospital for Special Surgery Reviewed / Revised Oct 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Key Points Topic Resources Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Herniated Disk (MRI Scan) Herniated nucleus pulposus is prolapse of an intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus.
Posterior protrusion may compress the cord in the cervical, thoracic, or upper lumbar spine or the cauda equina, especially in a congenitally narrow spinal canal (spinal stenosis).
In the lumbar area, > 80% of disk ruptures affect L5 or S1 nerve roots.
Herniated disks are common.
Symptoms and Signs of Lumbar Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Herniated disks often cause no symptoms, or they may cause symptoms and signs in the distribution of affected nerve roots.
Pain usually develops suddenly, and back pain is typically relieved by rest and activity modification.
In contrast, nerve root pain caused by an epidural tumor or abscess begins more insidiously, and back pain is worse at night while in bed.
Cauda equina compression often results in urine retention or incontinence due to loss of sphincter function.
In patients with lumbosacral herniation, coughing, sneezing, and activities such as sitting and bending forward increase the pain.
Diagnosis of Lumbar Herniated Nucleus Pulposus MRI or CT Diagnosis is usually suspected during a history and physical examination and confirmed by MRI or CT.
The physical examination should include the an evaluation of strength, sensation, and reflexes.
The tear causes pain due to irritation of sensory nerves in the disk, and when the disk impinges on an adjacent nerve root, a segmental radiculopathy with paresthesias and weakness in the distribution of the affected root results.
Tests for dural tension should also be done.
On examination, with the patient in supine with legs extended, raising the leg may cause pain to radiate down the posterior thigh to below the knee (straight leg-raising test).
Straightening the knee while sitting can produce similar pain (sitting straight-leg raising test).
A variation of this test in which straightening the knee with the patient sitting and bending forward at the waist with the foot dorsiflexed is called the slump test.
In upper lumbar disc herniation (L1 - 2, L2 - 3), extending the leg at the hip with the patient prone can cause pain radiating into the anterior thigh (femoral stretch test).
Achilles tendon and patellar reflexes may be diminished or absent.
MRI or CT can identify the cause and precise level of the lesion.
Rarely (ie, when MRI is contraindicated and CT is inconclusive), CT myelography is necessary.
Electrodiagnostic testing may help identify the involved root.
Diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI or CT.
Because an asymptomatic herniated disk is common, the clinician must carefully correlate symptoms with MRI abnormalities before invasive procedures are considered.
Treatment of Lumbar Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Conservative treatment initially Invasive procedures, sometimes including surgery, if neurologic deficits are progressive or severe Because a herniated disk desiccates and shrinks over time, symptoms tend to abate regardless of treatment.
Up to 85% of patients with back pain—regardless of cause—recover without surgery within 6 weeks.
Conservative treatment Treatment of a herniated disk should be conservative unless neurologic deficits are progressive or severe.
Heavy or vigorous physical activity is restricted, but ambulation and light activity (eg, lifting objects < 2.5 to 5 kg [about 5 to 10 lb] using correct techniques) are permitted as tolerated; prolonged bed rest and traction are no longer indicated.
Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other analgesics should be used as needed to relieve pain.
Oral methylprednisolone may be given, tapered over 6 days, starting with 24 mg daily and decreased by 4 mg a day.
In selected patients, gabapentin and amitriptyline are often used for refractory neuropathic pain.
Physical therapy and home exercises can improve posture and strengthen back muscles and thus reduce spinal movements that further irritate or compress the nerve root.
Treatment of mild cases is with analgesics, activity modification, and physical therapy.
Percutaneous approaches to remove bulging disk material are still being evaluated.
Dissolving herniated disk material with local injections of the enzyme chymopapain is not recommended.
Lesions acutely compressing the spinal cord or cauda equina (eg, causing urine retention or incontinence) require immediate surgical evaluation (see diagnosis of spinal cord compression).
Key Points Herniated lumbar disks are common and usually affect nerve roots at L5 or S1.
If symptoms develop suddenly and back pain is relieved with rest, suspect a herniated disk rather than an epidural tumor or abscess.
Recommend analgesics, light activity as tolerated, and exercises to improve posture and strength; however, if pain or deficits are severe or worsening, consider invasive procedures.
Bed rest is rarely indicated.
Patients with progressive or severe neurologic deficits, intractable pain, conservative treatment failure, myelopathy, or cauda equina syndrome with associated sphincter dysfunction may require immediate or later elective surgery (eg, diskectomy, laminectomy).
Spinal vertebrae are separated by fibrocartilaginous disks consisting of an outer annulus fibrosus and an inner nucleus pulposus.
When degenerative changes (with or without trauma) result in protrusion or rupture of the nucleus through the annulus fibrosus in the lumbosacral or cervical area, the nucleus is displaced posterolaterally or posteriorly into the extradural space.
Radiculopathy occurs when the herniated nucleus compresses or irritates the nerve root.
Tibialis Posterior Tendinosis and Tibialis Posterior Tenosynovitis (Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction) By Kendrick Alan Whitney, DPM, Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine Reviewed / Revised Oct 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Topic Resources How to Examine the Foot How To Examine the Ankle Tibialis posterior tendinosis, which is degeneration of the tibialis posterior tendon, and tibialis posterior tenosynovitis are the most common causes of pain behind the medial malleolus.
If the tendon ruptures (eg, with chronic tendinosis), the foot may acutely flatten (arch collapse) and pain may extend into the sole.
In tenosynovitis, pain is typically more acute and the tendon may feel thick and swollen as it courses around the medial malleolus.
Diagnosis MRI Tibialis posterior tendinosis and tenosynovitis are diagnosed clinically.
Palpation of the tendon with the foot in an inverted plantar flexed position with applied resistance is usually painful.
Standing on the toes is usually painful and may not be possible if the tendon is ruptured or severely dysfunctional.
Pain and swelling with tenderness of the tibialis posterior tendon behind the medial malleolus is suggestive of tenosynovitis.
Unilateral arch collapse with medial ankle bulging and forefoot abduction (too many toes sign) is particularly suggestive of advanced tendon pathology and warrants testing for tendon rupture.
MRI or ultrasonography can confirm a fluid collection around the tendon (indicating tenosynovitis) or the extent of chronic degradation or tearing to the tendon with associated tendinosis.
How to Examine the Foot VIDEO How To Examine the Ankle VIDEO Treatment Orthotics and braces or surgery Complete rupture of the tibialis posterior tendon requires surgery if normal function is the goal.
Surgery is especially important in young active patients with acute tears.
The posterior tibial tendon lies immediately behind the medial malleolus.
Conservative therapy consists of mechanically off-loading the tendon by using custom-molded ankle braces or orthotics modified with a deepened heel cup and appropriate medial wedging or posting.
Corticosteroid injections exacerbate the degenerative process (see Considerations for using corticosteroid injections).
For tenosynovitis, rest and aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy are warranted.
Degeneration results from long-standing biomechanical problems, such as excessive pronation (often in obese people) or chronic tenosynovitis.
Tenosynovitis of the tendon sheath begins with acute inflammation.
The tendon can be involved by primary inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout.
Symptoms and Signs Early on, patients experience occasional pain behind the medial malleolus.
Over time, the pain becomes severe, with painful swelling behind the medial malleolus.
Normal standing, walking, and standing on the toes become difficult.
Posterior Achilles Tendon Bursitis By Kendrick Alan Whitney, DPM, Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine Reviewed / Revised Oct 2021 | Modified Sep 2022 View Patient Education Symptoms and Signs Diagnosis Treatment Topic Resources How to Examine the Foot How To Examine the Ankle Posterior Achilles tendon bursitis is inflammation of a bursa that forms in response to shoe pressure and is located at the top edge of the posterior shoe counter between the skin and Achilles tendon.
Early symptoms may be limited to redness, pain, and warmth.
Later, superficial skin erosion may occur.
After months or longer, a fluctuant, tender, cystic nodule 1 - to 3-cm in diameter develops.
It is red or skin-colored.
In chronic cases, the bursa becomes fibrotic and calcified.
Diagnosis Symptoms and a small, tender, and skin-colored or red nodule The presence of the small, tender, and skin-colored or red nodule in a patient with symptoms consistent with posterior Achilles tendon bursitis is diagnostic.
Rarely, an Achilles tendon xanthoma develops at the top edge of the posterior shoe counter but tends to be pink and asymptomatic.
Achilles tendon enthesopathy causes pain mainly at the tendon's insertion but may also cause pain at the top edge of the posterior shoe counter.
Enthesopathy is differentiated by the absence of a soft-tissue lesion.
How to Examine the Foot VIDEO How To Examine the Ankle VIDEO Treatment Modification of footwear Properly fitting shoes with low heels are essential for people with posterior Achilles tendon bursitis.
A foam rubber or felt heel pad may be needed to lift the heel high enough so that the bursa does not contact the shoe counter.
Protective gel wraps, padding around the bursa, or the wearing of a backless shoe until inflammation subsides is indicated.
Foot orthotics may enhance rear foot stability and help reduce irritating motion on the posterior calcaneus while walking.
Warm or cool compresses, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and intrabursal injection of a local anesthetic / corticosteroid solution offer temporary relief; the Achilles tendon itself must not be injected (see Considerations for using corticosteroid injections).
Surgical removal of a portion of the underlying bone may rarely be necessary to reduce soft-tissue impingement.
Treatment is footwear modification.
Posterior Achilles tendon bursitis occurs mainly in young women.
Wearing high-heeled shoes is a risk factor.
Another risk factor is a bony prominence (Haglund deformity) on the calcaneus.
This deformity predisposes to bursa formation if repeatedly irritated by the shoe counter.
Symptoms and Signs Symptoms and signs of posterior Achilles tendon bursitis develop at the top edge of the posterior shoe counter.

Astrocytoma can have cysts.
Medulloblastoma and ependymoma can metastasize in the spinal cord and invade the brain stem.
All medulloblastomas are classified as malignant grade IV, low-grade astrocytomas (grade I and II) took 92.9% and the percentage of low-grade ependymoma is 64.7%.
The outcomes of cerebellar cancer treatment are not good in a histopathological manner.
The majority of patients died within the first year (78.3% of death cases).
The survival rate after 5 years estimated by Kaplan-Meier curve was 38% in general, specifically, this proportion of medulloblastoma and astrocytoma was 27% and 60% relatively, and most ependymoma patients died before the observation end (5 years).
After finding the results, here are some recommendations: It is essential to diagnose and treat early, combining treatment therapies is needed.
We need an organization managing and studying a compatible treatment therapy and a caring procedure to promote the survivability of children with cerebrum and cerebellar tumors.

Name of the thesis: Applied research sentinel lymph node biopsy in the treatment of the early stage breast cancer.
SLNB should be applied routinely for early-stage breast cancer with non-palpable lymph nodes.
Sentinel node accurately reflected the state of axillary lymph node metastasis of breast cancer patients, with the following indices of extemporary biopsy: sensitivity 88.9%, specificity 100%, accuracy 98.7%, and false negative rate of 11.1%.
In our trial, factors such as age patients, site of tumor, size of tumor and grading tumor do not relate to the ability of lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer.
Assessments of sentinel node biopsy methods outcomes: the average follow-up of 33.24 months reported that patients with pain, swelling and numbness arm in the group of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only were significant lower than the group of SLNB and completion axillary lymph node dissection, P <0.001.
3-year Kaplan Meier estimates for overall survival were 98.7% and 3-year Kaplan Meier estimates for disease-free survival was 98.3%.
There were 2.4% local recurrences in the group of breast conserving treatment and no cases ipsilateral axillary recurrences.
Our studies showed that SLNB method using blue methylene in the surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer is safe and effective, especially at breast surgery centers which do not access to radioisotopes facilities.

Name of the thesis: Study of morphology of abdominal trauma on dead victim from road traffic accident by forensic examination
Code: 62.72.01.05; Major: Pathology - Forensic Medicine
The new conclusions of the thesis: On the basis of forensic examination at Viet Duc Hospital for fatalities caused by road traffic accidents occurred in some northern provinces between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015, the thesis has identified a number of factors related to road traffic accidents such as the popularity of the type of means of transport, the time of the accident, the condition and the complexity of the trauma, the duration of the life after the accident, in order to alert people when taking part in traffic and provide scientifically valid evidence of road traffic accidents for the authorities to develop and implement more effective preventive measures.
The thesis focuses on external and internal trauma patterns of particular importance in the field of forensic examination.
External trauma make it possible for assessors to identify the mechanism of traumatic injury, the mode and the circumstances in which the vehicles cause the traumas, to facilitate the investigation of civil or criminal liability.
Study of internal traumas allows for the assessment of the location of traumatic organs, traumatic injuries, and associated traumas, in order to prevent them from being overlooked in emergency or treatment for the victim.
By studying the mechanism for causing the type of traumas corresponding to the trauma statistics and descriptions, the forensic examiner can estimate the morphology and extent of the internal trauma in the most likely way, in cases where relatives may not allow the agency to operate the dead body.
These understandings are the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of victims of road traffic accidents.

Subclinical examination intended to rise in 1995 (4.0) and 2012 (4.8).
Intervention study on management at Cham Pa Sac hospital was the first study carried out in Laos.
The study results had indicated some problems in planning and reporting activities of the hospital.
Therefore, some of solutions to management in the hospital were come up such as setting up operation plan, statistic report.
Those interventions had initially obtained encouraging results.
For the first time in Laos, a study on disease patterns was carried out in the hospital of Cham Pa Sac. From 1995 to 2012, the disease patterns of inpatients that belong to the transmitted diseases group making up the highest percentage.
In particular, there was improvement in both quantity and quality in terms of planning, reporting, monitoring and evaluating.
This result contributed to enhancing the quality of examination and treatment at Cham Pa Sac hospital and expanding the interventions on management at other provincial hospitals of Laos. At the same time, it also contributed to the quality of patient care and health care of people in general.
Noncommunicable diseases tended to increase, especially traffic accidents.
The percentages of infectious diseases, Noncommunicable ones and poisonous accidents in 1995 were 49.6%; 38.4%; and 11.9%; respectively and in 2012 were 37.1%; 42.8% and 20.1%, respectively.
The number of patients taken to the hospital accounted for the highest rate between June and August annually.
Name of thesis: Longitudinal study of Cranio-facial and dental arch growth in a group of Hanoi students aged 11 to 13 years old Specialization: Odonto-Stomatology Code: 62720601 PhD Student: Pham Cao Phong, Course 33 - Specialization in Odonto-Stomatology Instructors: 1.
The work identified 48 craniofaciodental, 7 dental arch sizes of each jaw; described the growth pattern of head and face, dental arch of 122 students from 11 to 13 years old to see the development principles of Vietnamese craniofacial structures.
These were the basic datapublished in first time in Vietnam, made the basis for the diagnosis and planning treatment for patients with orthodontics, as well as for the references in future research.
Currently in Vietnam, although there are some studies on craniofacial anthropometry, the standard measurements for each age, including the age from 11 to 13 years old is not enough, this age is one with high requirement for dental correction.
As a result, the physicians must be familiar with the craniofacial index of each age, understand deeply on the craniofacial and dental arch growth to diagnose and make the treatment plan for children.
With the method of measuring and analyzing on the distal lateral cephalometric radiographs and the gypsum samples of dental arches from 122 students aged 11 to 13 years old at three different measuring times, the Autocad software was used to film-drawing to ensure the accuracy in the technique of cephalometricradiograph overlapping, the method that has not been used by growth-studyingworks in Vietnam.

Title: Study on the variability and value of LH in the prognosis of polycystic ovary hyperstimulation in clomiphene citrate alone and in combination with FSH
Single-variable regression revealed a statistically significant association between LH levels and FSH levels, estrogen expressed in the following equations: [LH] = 0, 09 x [oestrogen] + 10, 06 R2 =0, 094 [LH] = 1, 35 x [FSH] + 6, 31 R2 =0, 148
There is a linear relationship between LH levels and the probability of not responding to treatment through the following equation: Ln (= - 0, 881 + 0, 017 x LH = e - 0, 881 + 0, 017xLH hay odd = e - 0, 881 + 0, 017xLH
There is a statistically significant decrease in LH when patients respond to ovulatory stimulation (with ovulation).
In contrast, if the response is not satisfactory, LH levels are almost unchanged before and after treatment.
Specialized: Obstetrics and Gynecology
New findings of thesis:
The mean LH level of infertile patients with polycystic ovaries was 14.48 ± 5.32 and LH ≥ 10 accounted for 81.4%.

79.3% of patients had surgery, in which 67.8% had radical surgery and 12.6% underwent anal sphincter-preserving surgery.
- Radiotherapy using a linear accelerator to deliver a dose of 46Gy combined with a preoperative Capecitabine regimen for low locally advanced rectal cancer was safe, acceptable and resulted in stable toxicities: hematological, hepatic-renal system, gastrointestinal, urinary tract and skin complications were mostly level 1, 2.
- HLA-B * 15: 02 was the most common HLA-B allele in Vietnamese patients (Kinh ethnicity) with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).
HLA-B * 51: 02 allele may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the traditional medicine-induced SJS / TEN.
There may possibly have a link between HLA-B alleles and causative drugs of SJS / TEN.
The HLA-B genotypes may be useful for suggesting the causative drugs in some cases and preventing SJS / TEN.
- Serum granulysin levels were significantly higher in SJS / TEN patients than in erythema multiforme (EM) patients.
After the onset of SJS / TEN, serum granulysin levels were not associated with the severity of the diseases.
- In SJS / TEN patients, serum levels of GM-CSF, TNF-α, IFN -, IL-6 and IL-12 were significantly higher than those in EM patients.
At the day of re-epithelialization, serum levels of GM-CSF, TNF-α, IFN -, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12 were significantly lower than those at the day of hospitalization.
Serum level of IFN - may be a good biomarker to differentiate SJS / TEN from EM as well as to evaluate the progress and the severity of SJS / TEN.
Through the study of cervical cancer screening for 8, 000 women who are in the age of 21 - 65 years old and had sexual intercourse in 24 rural communes of Vu Thu and Kien Xuong districts of Thai Binh province, we have conclusions as follows: 1.

Through a study of 109 transfusion-dependent pediatric thalassemia patients who were assessed iron overload and received deferiprone chelation therapy and followed in 1 year, we would give conclusions as follow: - It is possible to use many methods to assess iron overload at the same time: assessment by serum ferritin index showed that 97, 2% of thalassemia patients with iron overload; new technique T2 * magnetic resonance imaging has been used to measure liver T2 * relaxation time - LIC and heart T2 * relaxation time accurately and estimates the level of iron overload in the liver and heart: there were 99, 1% of patients having liver iron overload and 12, 8% had cardiac iron overload.
- There were correlations between LIC, cardiac MRI T2 * and serum ferritin index, therefore, in facilities that do not have appropriate conditions to use the MRI T2 * technique to assess tissue iron status or in pediatric patients with contraindications or inability to cooperate to perform this technique, we can still assess the patient's iron status by serum ferritin index in order to recommending an appropriate chelation treatment regimen.
- Deferiprone DFP is effective and safe in the treatment of hepatic and cardiac iron overload and reduction of serum ferritin levels in pediatric thalassemia patients with periodic blood transfusions: serum ferritin decreased 459 ng / ml, LIC decreased 4.7 mg / g dry liver, heart T2 * time increased 8.1 ms - The results obtained from the thesis have made a practical contribution to the assessment of iron burden as well as monitoring the effectiveness of deferiprone chelation therapy for pediatric thalassemia patients.

Scientists first posed this question in the mid-1990s, after researchers came upon a chemical agent that in rodents seemed to reproduce many of caloric restriction's benefits.
No compound that would safely achieve the same feat in people has been found yet, but the search has been informative and has fanned the hope that caloric-restriction (CR) mimetics can indeed be developed eventually.
The hunt for CR mimetics grew out of a desire to better understand caloric restriction's many effects on the body.
Scientists first recognized the value of the practice more than 60 years ago, when they found that rats fed a low-calorie diet lived longer on average than free-feeding rats and also had a reduced incidence of conditions that become increasingly common in old age.
What is more, some of the treated animals survived longer than the oldest-living animals in the control group, which means that the maximum lifespan (the oldest attainable age), not merely the normal lifespan, increased.
Various interventions, such as infection-fighting drugs, can increase a population's average survival time, but only approaches that slow the body's rate of aging will increase the maximum lifespan.
The rat findings have been replicated many times and extended to creatures ranging from yeast to fruit flies, worms, fish, spiders, mice and hamsters.
Until fairly recently, the studies were limited short-lived creatures genetically distant from humans.
But caloric-restriction projects underway in two species more closely related to humans - rhesus and squirrel monkeys - have scientists optimistic that CR mimetics could help people.
The monkey projects demonstrate that compared with control animals that eat normally caloric-restricted monkeys have lower body temperatures and levels of the pancreatic hormone insulin, and they retain more youthful levels of certain hormones that tend to fall with age.
Studies of caloric restriction are showing the way.
The caloric-restricted animals also look better on indicators of risk for age-related diseases.
For example, they have lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels (signifying a decreased likelihood of heart disease) and they have more normal blood glucose levels (pointing to a reduced risk for diabetes, which is marked by unusually high blood glucose levels).
Further, it has recently been shown that rhesus monkeys kept on caloric-restricted diets for an extended time (nearly 15 years) have less chronic disease.
They and the other monkeys must be followed still longer, however, to know whether low-calorie intake can increase both average and maximum lifespans in monkeys.
Unlike the multitude of elixirs being touted as the latest anti-aging cure, CR mimetics would alter fundamental processes that underlie aging.
We aim to develop compounds that fool cells into activating maintenance and repair.
The best-studied candidate for a caloric-restriction mimetic, 2DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose), works by interfering with the way cells process glucose, it has proved toxic at some doses in animals and so cannot be used in humans.
But it has demonstrated that chemicals can replicate the effects of caloric restriction; the trick is finding the right one.
By limiting food intake, caloric restriction minimizes the amount of glucose entering cells and decreases ATP generation.
As researchers on aging noted recently, no treatment on the market today has been proved to slow human aging - the build-up of molecular and cellular damage that increases vulnerability to infirmity as we grow older.
When 2DG is administered to animals that eat normally, glucose reaches cells in abundance but the drug prevents most of it from being processed and thus reduces ATP synthesis.
Researchers have proposed several explanations for why interruption of glucose processing and ATP production might retard aging.
One possibility relates to the ATP-making machinery's emission of free radicals, which are thought to contribute to aging and such age-related diseases as cancer by damaging cells.
Reduced operation of the machinery should limit their production and thereby constrain the damage.
Another hypothesis suggests that decreased processing of glucose could indicate to cells that food is scarce (even if it isn't) and induce them to shift into an anti-aging mode that emphasizes preservation of the organism over such 'luxuries' as growth and reproduction.
But one intervention, consumption of a low-calorie * yet nutritionally balanced diet, works incredibly well in a broad range of animals, increasing longevity and prolonging good health.
Those findings suggest that caloric restriction could delay aging and increase longevity in humans, too.
Unfortunately, for maximum benefit, people would probably have to reduce their caloric intake by roughly thirty percent, equivalent to dropping from 2, 500 calories a day to 1, 750.
Few mortals could stick to that harsh regimen, especially for years on end.
But what if someone could create a pill that mimicked the physiological effects of eating less without actually forcing people to eat less?
Could such a 'caloric-restriction mimetic', as we call it, enable people to stay healthy longer, postponing age-related disorders (such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, heart disease and cancer) until very late in life?
This action widens the airway in the back of the throat and the snoring noise stops immediately.
Like anything else, some of these appliances are inferior solutions.
For example, some mouthpieces force the jaw into a closed position and, as a result, can feel uncomfortable and unnatural while sleeping.
Some of them also require you to soften the material inside stiff trays by boiling them in water, and require a near-perfect bite impression for the proper fit.
MRDs are frequently made by dentists for their patients and can cost several hundred dollars for the appliance, plus the cost of the dentist visits for fitting.
Thats why experts in the field of snoring are so excited about the new Living HingeZQuiet mouthpiece.
The ZQuiet mouthpiece offers several fundamental advances over traditional snoring prevention mouthpieces: - Comfort - The companys patent pending Living Hinge makes this mouthpiece remarkably comfortable.
-Immediate Fit - ZQuiet has developed a universal sizing system for their product so that it fits immediately no boiling and molding process is required.
-Effectiveness - The ZQuiet mouthpiece is already being used successfully by thousands of people and, unlike most other snoring mouthpieces offered online, this one is FDA cleared to treat snoring.
Most of us do it to some degree and, generally speaking, the older we get, the worse the condition gets.
-Value - Perhaps the most innovative thing about the ZQuiet mouthpiece is the companys commitment to providing its customers with a great value.
The ZQuiet mouthpiece sells for less than $60.
Snoring can put a huge strain on our most important relationship in life, as the person with whom one shares their bed often suffers chronically as a result of their partner's snoring.
Thats because its the leading symptom of Obstructive Sleep Apnea * which left untreated can lead to chronic fatigue, high blood pressure, weight gain, and even heart failure and stroke.
So, treating snoring can make a huge difference in a person's long term health not to mention the more immediate benefits of a solid night's sleep every night and the pleasure of waking rested and ready to handle the day.
Unfortunately, effective treatments for snoring have been highly intrusive and expensive.
They include procedures like surgery, in which a doctor cuts away or shrinks tissue in the back of the throat, or an expensive and often-times uncomfortable CPAP face mask which forces air into the lungs keeping the air passages open while you sleep.
One of the more popular treatments for snoring is whats known as a Mandibular Repositioning Device (MRD), which is worn as a dental mouthpiece and works by adjusting the position of the lower jaw while you sleep.

Alternatively, grind 100 mung beans with ten peppercorns in a food processor.
Take a spoonful of the powder and add hot water to make an anti-nausea drink.
According to the herbalist Nguyen Cong Duc of the Ho Chi Minh City University of Medicine and Pharmacy, mung beans are a sweet and cooling food.
They help in detoxing the body.
Mung beans act as a diuretic, help fortify the stomach, and decrease fat.
The beans are rich in potassium and sodium, so they lower blood pressure.
Herbalist Duc suggests incorporating mung beans into your diet with these recipes: - To fight aging and fortify the skin, try the mung bean and pork liver porridge.
In a pot, take 100g mung beans and 100g rice.
Alzheimer's Disease Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's memory, thinking, and reasoning skills. People with dementia often have trouble thinking and speaking clearly, remembering recent events, and learning new things.
Alzheimer's disease is named after Dr Alois Alzheimer, a German doctor.
In 1906, Dr Alzheimer noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness.
He found abnormal clumps and tangled bundles of fibers.
The clumps are now called amyloid plaques and the tangles are called neurofibrillary tangles.
Today, these plaques and tangles in the brain are considered signs of Alzheimer's disease.
Scientists also have found other brain changes in people with Alzheimer's disease.
There is a loss of nerve cells and pathways in areas of the brain that are vital to memory and other mental abilities.
There also are lower levels of some of the chemicals in the brain that carry complex messages back and forth between nerve cells. Alzheimer's disease may disrupt normal thinking and memory by blocking these messages between nerve cells.
Over time, it becomes hard for them to handle everyday activities and take care of themselves.
There are many causes of dementia, but Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older persons.
Scientists think that up to 4.5 million people in the United States suffer from Alzheimer's disease.
The disease usually begins after age 65 and risk goes up with age.
While younger people also may get Alzheimer's disease, it is much less common.
About 5 percent of men and women ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimer's disease, and nearly half of those age 85 and older may have the disease.
It is important to note, however, that Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging.
How To Get Good Posture - Để có dáng đi tốt Understanding exactly what correct posture consists of is something that is critically important, however something many people dont quite get.
Shoulder Positioning Going up the body, you also want your shoulders to be pulled back, thinking of squeezing at the shoulder blades while opening up the chest as best as possible.
As you do this, youll likely feel your entire upper body shift slightly, and you might even notice you increase in height.
Neck Positioning The next factor to consider about correct posture is neck positioning.
The neck should always be in a relaxed neutral position with the shoulders pressed down.
Many of us get into the position of sticking the neck out too forward while shrugging at the shoulders (due to stress).
Take a second during your day to press the shoulders down and make sure the neck is relaxed.
Foot Positioning Finally, while some people do have a naturally turned out foot position, for the most part youll want your feet to be facing directly forward, about shoulder width apart.
This is important so that you dont start to suffer from knee or lower back pain as you walk.
When the feet are not placed properly, there can be tension forces acting on the knee ligaments, which can become very problematic over the long term.
So, make sure you have a good idea what correct posture is and then put that into action.
This is unfortunate because using correct posture is going to impact many areas of your life such as your self-confidence, how thin you look, your risk for injuries, and how much energy you have on a day to day basis.
Make a conscious effort everyday to monitor your posture and make sure youre not slipping up.
Here is what you need to know about what correct posture is.
Hip Positioning When trying to obtain correct posture, your hip positioning should be upwards, with the glutes squeezed.
Do your best to pull the hips upwards to prevent this from occurring.
By looking sideways into a mirror you can easily see exactly what position your hips are in.
Abdominal Positioning Moving on, while you lift up your hips, at the same time this should cause you to squeeze the stomach slightly.
This will enable you to adopt a firmer stomach position, instantly making you look thinner.
BRAIN IN LOVE I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others, have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.
So, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.
And every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox, the sun rises behind his temple, and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.
And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon, it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.
After 1, 300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting our third experiment: studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage.
So, this is the short story of that research.
In the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.
It was built by the grandest Sun King, of the grandest city state, of the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.
He lived into his 80s, and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife.
Fetal education The guidance in the fetal sensory function and action should be instantly performed step by step in a planned way to promote the development of infantile intelligence and behavior during the best developmental period of the function of the fetal sensory system.
Therefore, the pregnant woman should avoid bad stimulations like obscene and evil things, violence, killing and ugliness so as not to affect the fetal development.
Fetal / prenatal education in 4th month Important work is taking place in babys brain.
This month, his / her nerve cells will increase rapidly, especially in the front of the brain, where thinking takes place.
Fatty sheaths, which act like insulators on electrical wires to speed messages as they travel, have begun to form around the nerve of the spinal cord.
Also during this month, the babys senses continue to awaken.
The baby has begun to develop his / her ear from inside out.
He / she can not only hear the sounds of the mothers heart beating and blood, but also discern my voices.
According to these changes, I changed my fetal education practice a little bit.
During this month, I decide to do the following things for him / her: 1.
Strive for tranquility; establish the security and support I need to cultivate the peace of mind.
For example, 13 weeks after the gestation, planned speaking and recitation of poems are kept for the fetus; singing songs and playing tapes may be arranged to let the fetus listen to the melodious and beautiful music or songs.
Try to stay away from people and things that make me anxious, angry, depressed, or sad.
Listen to simple, soothing and beautiful music once a day.
The music is neither loud nor noisy, and I only listen to it no more than 20 minuets each time.
Name my baby a nickname and have loving conversations with my baby.
Every day when I get up, brush my teeth, have the breakfast / lunch / supper, or begin to work, I call my baby by this nickname and tell him / her what I am doing.
And I also encourage babys daddy to do the same, although his conversation is much simpler.
Poor daddy, or hi, baby, daddy is back.
Apart from these, the mother's sounds of talking and laughing with others, the bird's singing, the insect's singing and the murmuring stream in a forest are all the good information to promote the development of the fetal auditognosis and nervous system.
How are you today?
Continue to create a calm, loving, peaceful internal environment.
Give the baby more detailed and vivid descriptions of my daily activities.
I not only just tell baby what I do everyday, but also get him / her involved, asking him / her questions or opinions like a real conversation.
At the same time, I aslo encourage babys daddy M to speak to him / her whenever he gets time, let him rub or pat my tummy gently when he talks to the baby, and tell him / her who he is, say hello to him / her, show how much he loves him / her, and etc.
We both treat the baby as a real family member, show him / her our love, tell him / her how happy and how eager we want to see him / her in months.
Researches have found that if the pregnant woman often listens to lively and sweet music, the fetus will be less restless and grow and develop well; if the pregnant woman is usually exposed to the noisy and deafening rock and roll music, the fetus will be more restless.
Begin to read short poems or children stories to baby.
Once or twice a week, I read an ancient poem to baby.
I choose a very simple poem and keep repeating the same one to him / her.
The poem I read to baby descibes a poor peasant working under the scorching sun of the noon, with big drops of sweat falling into the ground.
The poem asks who knows that every grain of rice in our bowl is produced with every drop of sweat of peasants.
After reading the poem to my baby, I also explained to him / her its moral meanings, and wished he / she would respect other peoples hard work and learn to be frugal in the future.
Again, the purpose of reading poems or stories to the baby is not to make him / her remember those poems or stories, nor to influence him / her to become a literature lover, but to let the baby get used to our voices, show our care and love, and build a compassionate parent-baby relationship.
Regulating the diet The pregnant woman's diet should be fresh, bland, nutritious, light, and moderate in amount.
First trimester of pregnancy (three months since conception): Small amount of fine diet is advisable due to the slow fetal development as well as the reaction of pregnancy.
Every night before bed time, lying in the bed, the pregnant woman put her hands on her abdomen and strokes the fetus to promote the fetal movement.
The pregnant woman may select the food suitable for her taste and slightly sour orectic food, fresh vegetables and fruits being the best ones.
However, the fishy, pungent and irritative foods should be contraindicated to avoid aggravating the vomiting of pregnancy.
Second trimester of pregnancy: The fetus grows fast.
Ingestion of food rich in protein, calcium and phosphorus is advisable for the pregnant woman.
Paddy, beans, meat, fish and eggs contain rich proteins.
Calcium exits in yolk, milk, dried small shrimps, animal skeletons and green leafy vegetables; phosphorus in soybean, chicken and mutton.
Eating these foods can promote tissue growth, strengthen the bone, benefit marrow, tonify the brain to promote the fetal development.
Third trimester of pregnancy (eight to ten months in pregnancy): The fetal growth and development accelerate.
This is the crucial period for the cerebral development.
Thus, more nutrients should be stored.
This can arouse the initiative of fetal movement to let the fetus receive earlier training in standing and walking than the untrained fetus.
The pregnant woman should eat more fine proteins, pay attention to proper proportion of animal protein and vegetable protein, eat less salt and basic food to prevent edema.
The pregnant woman should avoid irritative foods like hot pepper, sensitized foods like crab meat, and river deer and hare.
It is advisable for her to give up smoking, drinking spirit and strong tea in case abortion, premature labor, dead fetus, monster and congenital diseases should occur.
Living a normal daily life After conception, exogenous pathogenic factors easily invade the pregnant woman, giving rise to various fetal diseases, even abortion.
Thus, the pregnant woman should live a normal daily life with caution and arrange the daily schedule scientifically.
She should rise early and go to bed early, and work, study and live regularly.
Besides, she should modify her clothing to prevent cold and summer heat in conformity to seasonal variations.
The strenuous exercise is not advisable for the pregnant woman.
The pregnant woman should not climb high, walk fast, sit in a lateral position, bend over, limp along, lean against something, take an object from a high place, defecate and urinate in the out of the way places, stand, sit and lie long, expose herself to cold and heat.
The pregnant woman should be cautious not to hit the abdomen, avoid being exposed to noxious substances like lead, mercury, benzol and arsenic as well as radioactive rays.
This method is advisable for regular use and it is more important during the gestational period.
It is not advisable for her to visit public places often to prevent infectious diseases causing the fetal injury or abortion.
The pregnant woman should maintain smooth defecation and urination.
In the case of constipation without remission or dysuria, she should go to see a doctor in time.
But it is contraindicated in the pregnant woman with early uterine contraction.
Avoiding evil things Frequent contact with beautiful things may beautify the fetus.
Millennium Development Goals on health 'will not be met' By Jane Dreaper Health correspondent, BBC News The under-five death rate remains too high in the developing world Researchers say just nine of 137 developing countries will achieve ambitious targets to improve the health of women and children.
Intervention strategies There were 273, 500 maternal deaths, of which 56, 100 were related to HIV.
In 1990, an estimated 409, 100 women died during pregnancy or childbirth.
The highest level of maternal death is seen in Eritrea, Liberia and Afghanistan.
The lowest is in Iceland and Austria.
Countries making slower progress on the infant death target include Nigeria and Ethiopia.
The authors said 23 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were unlikely at the present pace to achieve MDG4 before 2040.
Many aspects of health systems limit the scale-up of child and maternal interventions, they said.
Nevertheless, some intervention strategies can be delivered without a health system that has the capacity for referral and emergency management.
These include vaccination, distributing insecticide-treated bed nets, vitamin A supplementation and deworming.
They praised India for promising and substantial progress in reducing maternal mortality during the past five years.
The analysis in The Lancet updates previous estimates of progress on the fourth and fifth Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The authors concluded: The MDG targets have helped rally donors to recognise the urgent need for further investment.
Even with major accelerated efforts, most countries are unlikely to achieve both targets.
Although some might see this as a failure of global health action, it is perhaps more important to keep track of whether the pace of progress for children and mothers has improved.
A year ago, governments around the world pledged 25bn to reinvigorate efforts on both targets.
But the Lancet paper says the potential for delivering the aid is unclear, because aid money for health has been growing at a slower pace in recent years.
Midwife training The authors acknowledge estimating the death rates is contentious, and that their work has triggered a vigorous academic debate on measurement strategies.
In an accompanying comment, global health experts Peter Byass and Wendy Graham said: Numerical assessments against the MDGs are inevitably processes that are plagued by poor and missing data.
It is self-evident that the greatest numbers of avoidable deaths happen in some of the world's largest countries.
A report by the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH) - also released on Tuesday - says some of the world's poorest countries have pledged 7bn of their own resources to try to reduce the death rates.
Bangladesh has committed to train 3, 000 midwives by 2015, while Congo has promised to provide free obstetric care, including Caesarean sections.
The experts predict that no country in sub-Saharan Africa will meet the goals to dramatically reduce deaths by 2015.
But they say progress is speeding up in most countries.
The targets were set by world leaders in 2000.
MDG4 aims to reduce the death rate for children aged under five by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.
MDG5 states an ambition to cut deaths among pregnant women and new mothers by three-quarters during the same timescale.
The researchers from Seattle estimate there were 7.2 m infant deaths around the world in the past year - compared with 11.6 m in 1990.
China, Rwanda and Botswana were praised for substantial acceleration in tackling child mortality in the past decade.
